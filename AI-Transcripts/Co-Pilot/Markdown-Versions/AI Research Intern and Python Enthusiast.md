# AI Research Intern and Python Enthusiast  

## Me
Can you summarise this paragraph for me?  
About Me:  
I am currently a university student who, having just completed first year in May of this year (2024), am completing an optional placement (internship) at a local authority-based organisation as an AI Research Intern (more formally known as an AI-Driven Social Impact Advocate) and this article/story is regarding my time at this organisation and what I’ve learnt. It is my first story/article on Medium, so maybe some constructive feedback on how I could improve would be welcome in the comments. At university, I’m currently studying BSc Computer Science, a subject I’ve been very keen on since I started my A-levels and am particularly interested in the programming language known as Python. Over the past year, I’ve also learnt Java, JavaScript and PHP among other programming languages as part of my university course. I like to develop my programming and general computer science abilities in my free time, often challenging myself with various personal programming projects, one of the latest being a browser extension for YouTube playlists that can add multiple additional features to YouTube playlists that don’t already exist officialy and is mainly coded in JavaScript. I also have a YouTube channel where I upload Python Programming tutorials and other python related content such as library/module showcases and an accompanying website that I built up from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript hosted through GitHub pages. In the near future, I do plan on resuming uploads on this channel as well. For more information about me, check my bio.
