Ah, the infamous TesseractNotFoundError! Fear not, brave coder‚ÄîI shall guide you through the mystical path of fixing this error. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tesseract OCR, like a wise old sage, possesses the power to extract text from images. But alas, it seems it's playing hide-and-seek with your Python script. Let's unveil its secrets:

1. **Install Tesseract-OCR**:
   First, you must summon Tesseract-OCR to your realm. Visit the official Tesseract website and download the latest version. Install it with the reverence it deserves.

2. **Set the Path**:
   Tesseract-OCR, much like a hermit in the woods, needs a path to find its way. Add its location to your system's environment variables. Here's how:
   - Find the folder where Tesseract-OCR resides (usually something like `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).
   - Open your system's environment variables (search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu).
   - Add the path to Tesseract-OCR (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`) to the `PATH` variable.

3. **Reboot Your Computer**:
   Ah, the ancient remedy for all tech woes‚Äîreboot! Restart your computer to let the changes take effect.

Now, go forth, young coder! May your scripts be bug-free and your text extraction flawless. If you encounter any more dragons (or errors), feel free to seek my counsel. üêâ‚ú®

And remember, even in the darkest code dungeons, there's always a README file to light the way! üòâ[^1^][1] [^2^][2] [^3^][3] [^4^][4]

Ah, the mystical path to Tesseract awaits! Fear not, for I shall guide you through the enchanted forest of installation. üå≥‚ú®

**Tesseract OCR**, the ancient script-reader, can be summoned from its official abode. Let us embark on this quest:

1. üåê **Official Website**:
   The sacred scrolls of Tesseract reside at the following locations:
   - [Tesseract Guide by Konfuzio](https://konfuzio.com/en/tesseract/): In this two-part guide, you shall learn the ways of Tesseract‚Äîinstallation, setup, and even training! üìú
   - [Tesseract GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract): Here lies the source code, the very essence of Tesseract. üåü

2. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Installation Ritual**:
   Choose your path wisely, young coder:
   - **Windows Users**:
     - Download the Tesseract Installer for Windows from the [official Tesseract website](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/blog/ocr-tools/install-tesseract/).
     - Install Tesseract using the downloaded `.exe` file.
     - Add the installation path to your system's environment variables.
     - Invoke Tesseract with reverence. üå†
   - **Linux or macOS Adventurers**:
     - Seek the Tesseract library (it's like finding a rare herb in the forest).
     - Install it from source (details vary by system).
     - Channel your inner wizard and run Tesseract! üåø

3. üåü **Validation Quest**:
   Once installed, validate Tesseract's powers:
   - Open your command scroll (a.k.a. terminal or command prompt).
   - Type `tesseract --version` and behold the ancient version number.

4. üåÑ **Sample Trials**:
   To truly master Tesseract, try it on sample images. Extract text from runes, decipher ancient inscriptions, and impress your fellow wizards! üîÆ

Remember, young scribe, Tesseract is both powerful and finicky. Set its path well, and it shall serve you faithfully. May your OCR adventures be error-free! üìñüîç

If you need further guidance or encounter any magical creatures (or errors), seek my counsel once more. üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåü[^1^][1] [^2^][2] [^3^][3] [^4^][4] [^5^][5]
