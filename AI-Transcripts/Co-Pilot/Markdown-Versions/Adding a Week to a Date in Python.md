You can achieve this using Python's `datetime` module. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Import the necessary classes** from the `datetime` module.
2. **Parse the date string** into a `datetime` object.
3. **Add one week** to the date using `timedelta`.
4. **Format the new date** back into the desired string format.

Here's a sample code snippet:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Step 1: Parse the date string into a datetime object
date_str = "27 August 2024"
date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%d %B %Y")

# Step 2: Add one week to the date
new_date_obj = date_obj + timedelta(weeks=1)

# Step 3: Format the new date back into the desired string format
new_date_str = new_date_obj.strftime("%d %B %Y")

print(new_date_str)  # Output: 03 September 2024
```

This code will output `03 September 2024`, which is one week after `27 August 2024`.

You can calculate someone's age in whole years using Python's `datetime` module. Here's a simple way to do it:

1. **Import the necessary classes** from the `datetime` module.
2. **Parse the date of birth** into a `datetime` object.
3. **Get the current date**.
4. **Calculate the age** by subtracting the birth year from the current year and adjusting if the current date is before the birth date in the current year.

Here's a sample code snippet:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Step 1: Parse the date of birth into a datetime object
dob_str = "18 April 2012"
dob = datetime.strptime(dob_str, "%d %B %Y")

# Step 2: Get the current date
current_date = datetime.today()

# Step 3: Calculate the age in whole years
age = current_date.year - dob.year - ((current_date.month, current_date.day) < (dob.month, dob.day))

print(age)  # Output: 12 (as of 27 August 2024)
```

This code will output `12`, which is the age of someone born on `18 April 2012` as of `27 August 2024`.

To extract data from a Word document organized as a table using Python, you can use the `python-docx` library. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you extract the table data:

1. **Install the `python-docx` library** if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install python-docx
   ```

2. **Use the following code** to extract the table data:

   ```python
   from docx import Document

   # Load the document
   doc = Document("Example filled Breaking Cycles Referral Form.docx")

   # Iterate through the tables in the document
   for table in doc.tables:
       for row in table.rows:
           for cell in row.cells:
               print(cell.text)
   ```

This code will print the text from each cell in the tables of your Word document.

If you find that `python-docx` isn't handling the tables as you need, you can consider converting the Word document to a PDF and then extracting the table data from the PDF. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Convert the Word document to a PDF** using the `docx2pdf` library:
   ```bash
   pip install docx2pdf
   ```

2. **Use the following code** to convert the document:
   ```python
   from docx2pdf import convert

   # Convert the Word document to PDF
   convert("Example filled Breaking Cycles Referral Form.docx")
   ```

3. **Extract the table data from the PDF** using a library like `pdfplumber`:
   ```bash
   pip install pdfplumber
   ```

4. **Use the following code** to extract table data from the PDF:
   ```python
   import pdfplumber

   # Open the PDF file
   with pdfplumber.open("Example filled Breaking Cycles Referral Form.pdf") as pdf:
       for page in pdf.pages:
           tables = page.extract_tables()
           for table in tables:
               for row in table:
                   print(row)
   ```

This approach should help you extract the table data accurately. Let me know if you need further assistance!
