# Birthday Pack Opening Script for YouTube Shorts  

## Me
How can I write a script for a YouTube shorts with a cyclical structure where I want to say:  
- It's my birthday today and EA gave me a birthday gift
- I logged into the companion app to do my daily login SBC
- Then I opened the pack, but not the 81x2 from completion, the 84x2 from objectives for it
- and then this happened (I packed Messi the Goat)

## Co-Pilot
Here’s a script that follows a cyclical structure for your YouTube Shorts:

---

**[Opening shot]**
*Camera pans in on a celebratory setup with balloons and a birthday cake.*

**You (excited):** 
"Hey everyone, guess what? It's my birthday today, and EA gave me a birthday gift! 🎉"

---

**[Cut to you opening the companion app on your phone]**
*Close-up of the screen showing the companion app.*

**You (voiceover):** 
"I logged into the companion app to do my daily login SBC..."

---

**[Cut to you opening the pack]**
*Show the screen with the 84x2 pack.*

**You (voiceover):** 
"Then I opened the pack, but not the 81x2 from completion, the 84x2 from objectives for it..."

---

**[Cut to the pack opening animation]**
*Dramatic music builds up as the pack opens.*

**You (excited):** 
"And then this happened...!"

---

**[Show the card reveal - Messi the Goat]**
*Zoom in on Messi's card.*

**You (excited):** 
"I packed Messi, the Goat! 🐐"

---

**[Closing shot]**
*Camera returns to the celebratory setup.*

**You (smiling):** 
"Best birthday gift ever! Thank you, EA! 🎉 Don't forget to like and subscribe for more epic pulls!"

In addition, here are some tips to make your YouTube Shorts even more engaging:
1. **Keep it Snappy:** Make sure your script is concise and to the point to maintain viewer interest.
2. **Use Captions:** Add captions for accessibility and to cater to viewers who might be watching without sound.
3. **Exciting Visuals:** Use exciting visuals, like animations and close-ups, to keep the viewer engaged.
