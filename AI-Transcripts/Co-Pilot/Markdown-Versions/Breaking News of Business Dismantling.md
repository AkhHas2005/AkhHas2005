# Breaking News of Business Dismantling  

## Me
I was planning a Software Business to open in approximately 2 years with 2 of my old school friends. Fairly recently, I invited 3 of my university friends to join and we were gonna set up a meeting for next week with all 6 of us. However we couldn't find an availablity time for all of us. Then, all of a sudden my old school friend decided to leave and not take part in it. Now, I also feel like I can't do the business, how can I break the news to my university friends (in person), I wish to mention the following reasons for my dismantling of the business much before it's even started:   
- I've got too, too much going on and I'm always gonna have a lot going on
- One of the old school friends (Adam) decided to leave the business and I don't want to continue either
- There's not much point in it anymore, there's loads of other things we can do instead
- We couldn't find a good time for the meeting and it's gonna be really hard to do meetings on this as well then

I'm sorry to hear that things didn't work out with your business plans. It's always tough to break news like this, but approaching it with honesty and respect will go a long way. Here's a possible way to frame your conversation:

---

**Start with gratitude and context:**

"Hey everyone, first of all, I want to thank you all for showing interest in our business idea and being willing to give your time and energy to it. I truly appreciate it."

**Explain your reasons clearly:**

"I've been doing some thinking, and I wanted to discuss something important with you. There are a few reasons why I believe it's best to step back from this business venture for now.

1. I've got too much going on, and I'm always going to have a lot on my plate. Juggling everything has become overwhelming.
2. Adam, one of the original school friends, has decided to leave the business, and this has made me reconsider my own involvement.
3. Without Adam, it feels like there's not much point in continuing. There are loads of other things we could do instead.
4. We struggled to find a suitable time for our meeting, which makes me worry about how difficult it will be to coordinate in the future."

**Offer reassurance and open dialogue:**

"I hope you understand my perspective. It's not an easy decision, and I didn't come to it lightly. If you have any thoughts or feelings about this, please let me know. I'm open to discussing it further and hearing what you all think."

Ending on a respectful and open note ensures that your friends feel heard and valued, even if the project isn’t moving forward. Good luck!

How can I format it as an informal and colloquial text as individual message to my friends

Sure thing! Here's an informal and colloquial way to break the news to your friends:

Hey [Friend's Name],

Hope you're doing well. Just wanted to chat about the business idea we've been planning. After giving it a lot of thought, I've decided to step back for a few reasons.

First off, I've got way too much going on right now and it's just gonna keep piling up. Then, with Adam deciding to leave the group, it made me rethink the whole thing. Without him, it doesn't feel the same anymore. Plus, we couldn't even find a good time for our first meeting, which is a sign it'll be tough to coordinate in the future.

I think there are plenty of other things we could focus on instead. Hope you understand, and we can still hang out and catch up on other stuff!

Cheers,
[Your Name]

Feel free to tweak it to make it sound more like your own voice. Good luck!
