# Building an AI Testing Agent in Vertex AI  

## Me
Give me 5 possible chatGPT/Copilot prompts that would give me relevant information needed to start building an AI testing Agent from scratch in Vertex AI agent builder such as what to fill in each section and how to link the agents together. The agent should be able to scan a document (pdf or microsoft word doc) using document intelligence, extract information from it realting to the user's initial prompt, extract text form an image, compare the text from the image to the infgormation extracted from the document and provide a brief summary of how the test went using the comparison. The document and image should both be able to be uploaded by the user from the agent interface. If you need anymore information about how to structure the prompt, feel free to ask (:

Certainly! Let's break down the steps for building your AI testing agent in Vertex AI Agent Builder. Here are five prompts to guide you:

1. **Define the Agent's Goal and Use Case:**
   - Start by identifying the purpose of your agent. What specific task or problem will it address? For instance, you want an agent that can compare text extracted from documents and images.
   - Consider use cases, such as document verification, data extraction, or content summarization.

2. **Create Conversational Examples:**
   - Gather conversational examples that demonstrate how users will interact with your agent. These examples should cover various scenarios related to document and image processing.
   - For instance:
     - "User: Upload a document."
     - "Agent: Sure! Please upload the document you'd like me to process."

3. **Design the Agent's Flow:**
   - Outline the steps the agent will take during interactions. For your use case:
     - Document upload â†’ Text extraction â†’ Image upload â†’ Text extraction from image â†’ Comparison â†’ Summary.
   - Specify the order of these steps and any conditional logic.

4. **Configure Document Intelligence:**
   - In the Vertex AI Agent Builder, set up the document intelligence component.
   - Define how the agent will process uploaded documents (PDFs or Word docs). You can use Vertex AI Search for grounding the extracted information.
   - Provide instructions for the agent to extract relevant data from the document.

5. **Handle Image Text Extraction and Comparison:**
   - Add a step for image text extraction. You can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like Google Cloud Vision API.
   - Compare the extracted text from the document and the image. You might need to preprocess the text (e.g., remove special characters, normalize case) for accurate comparison.
   - Based on the comparison results, generate a summary of the test outcome.

Remember to consider security, error handling, and user experience while building your agent. Good luck! ðŸ¤–ðŸš€[^1^][4] [^2^][5] [^3^][6]
