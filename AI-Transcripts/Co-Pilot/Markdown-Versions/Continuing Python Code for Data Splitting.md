# Continuing Python Code for Data Splitting  

## Me
Here is my current Python code, how can I continue it based on the comments:  

```Python
#Mount google drive
from google.colab
import drive drive.mount('/content/drive')

#import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Open the csv in the root directory (/content/drive/MyDrive/2. Documents/Hasan work/AI_Coursework2)
data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/2. Documents/Hasan work/AI_Coursework2/Dataset1.csv')

# Split the data into relevant labels and relevant features (x and y)
# x should comprise of Age, Smoker and HvyAlcoholConsump columns
# y should comprise HeartDiseaseorAttack, Diabetes, HighBP and HighChol
```

## Co-Pilot
Great start! Let's continue with the code to split the data into relevant labels (x) and features (y):

```python
# Select the relevant columns for x and y
x = data[['Age', 'Smoker', 'HvyAlcoholConsump']]
y = data[['HeartDiseaseorAttack', 'Diabetes', 'HighBP', 'HighChol']]

# Display the first few rows of x and y to check the split
print("Features (x):")
print(x.head())
print("\nLabels (y):")
print(y.head())
```

This will create two DataFrames: `x` with the columns Age, Smoker, and HvyAlcoholConsump, and `y` with the columns HeartDiseaseorAttack, Diabetes, HighBP, and HighChol. Finally, it prints the first few rows of each DataFrame to verify the data split.

How does this look? Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to add or modify!

How can I comntinue it with a multiclass classifier?  

## Co-Pilot
To continue with a multiclass classifier, we can use a classification algorithm like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or any other suitable algorithm that handles multiclass classification. I'll show you how to implement it using the Logistic Regression classifier from the `sklearn` library.

Here's the extended code to train a multiclass classifier:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features (mean=0, variance=1)
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test_scaled = scaler.transform(x_test)

# Initialize and train the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='ovr', max_iter=1000)
model.fit(x_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(x_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the accuracy and classification report
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

This code covers the following steps:
1. **Splitting the Data**: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Standardizing the Features**: Scales the feature data so it has a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
3. **Initializing and Training the Model**: Sets up and trains a Logistic Regression model for multiclass classification.
4. **Making Predictions**: Uses the model to predict the labels on the test set.
5. **Evaluating the Model**: Calculates and prints the accuracy and classification report.

This should set you up to train and evaluate a multiclass classifier. Is there anything more specific you'd like to do with the model or the data?  

## Me
I get this error, my previous code is this, how can I resolve it?

## Co-Pilot
The error you're encountering indicates that the target variable `y` needs to be a 1D array, while your `y` is currently a DataFrame with multiple columns. Each column in `y` likely represents a separate target label, so it seems like you want to train separate models for each target or transform the problem into a multilabel classification scenario.

Here's how you can train a separate model for each target variable:

```python
# Initialize the list to store the models and results
models = {}
results = {}

# Loop through each target variable
for target in y.columns:
    # Initialize and train the Logistic Regression model
    model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='ovr', max_iter=1000)
    model.fit(x_train_scaled, y_train[target])
    
    # Store the model
    models[target] = model
    
    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(x_test_scaled)
    
    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test[target], y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test[target], y_pred)
    
    # Store the results
    results[target] = {
        'accuracy': accuracy,
        'report': report
    }

# Print the accuracy and classification report for each target variable
for target, result in results.items():
    print(f"Target: {target}")
    print(f"Accuracy: {result['accuracy']:.2f}")
    print("Classification Report:\n", result['report'])
    print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")
```

In this approach, the code iterates through each column (target variable) in `y`, trains a separate Logistic Regression model for each, makes predictions, and then evaluates each model individually. This way, each target variable is treated independently, and the results are reported accordingly.

Give this a try and let me know if you run into any other issues or if there's anything more you'd like to add!  

## Me
No I want to transform the problem into a multilabel classification scenario.  

## Co-Pilot
Got it! Let's convert the problem into a multilabel classification scenario. We will use the `MultiOutputClassifier` from `sklearn` to handle multilabel classification with Logistic Regression. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features (mean=0, variance=1)
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test_scaled = scaler.transform(x_test)

# Initialize the Logistic Regression model
base_model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='ovr', max_iter=1000)

# Wrap the base model with MultiOutputClassifier to handle multilabel classification
model = MultiOutputClassifier(base_model)

# Train the model on the scaled training data
model.fit(x_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(x_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=y.columns)

# Print the accuracy and classification report
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

In this code:
1. **Initialization and Training**: We use `MultiOutputClassifier` to wrap the Logistic Regression model to handle multilabel classification.
2. **Evaluation**: We use `classification_report` with `target_names` to get detailed performance metrics for each label.

This approach treats each label independently while still using a single combined model, which is effective for multilabel classification problems. Try running this code, and let me know if you encounter any more issues or need further assistance!

ValueError: Classification metrics can't handle a mix of multiclass-multioutput and multilabel-indicator targets  

## Co-Pilot
I see, you're encountering an issue because the `classification_report` function is confused by the mix of multiclass and multilabel targets. Let's address both warnings and the error.

1. **Addressing the FutureWarning**: We'll use `OneVsRestClassifier` for the logistic regression model instead of setting `multi_class`.

2. **Fixing the Mix of Targets**: We'll ensure the targets are correctly formatted as multilabel indicators.

Here’s an updated version of your code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features (mean=0, variance=1)
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test_scaled = scaler.transform(x_test)

# Initialize the Logistic Regression model
base_model = OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))

# Wrap the base model with MultiOutputClassifier to handle multilabel classification
model = MultiOutputClassifier(base_model)

# Train the model on the scaled training data
model.fit(x_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(x_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model (we'll need to convert y_pred to a DataFrame for comparison)
y_pred_df = pd.DataFrame(y_pred, columns=y_test.columns)

# Calculate the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_df)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred_df, target_names=y.columns)

# Print the accuracy and classification report
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("Classification Report:\n", report)
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Changed to `OneVsRestClassifier`**: Adjusted the Logistic Regression model to use `OneVsRestClassifier` to avoid the deprecation warning.
2. **Formatted Predictions Correctly**: Converted the predictions (`y_pred`) to a DataFrame to ensure compatibility with the evaluation functions.

Give this updated code a try, and it should resolve the warnings and errors you're encountering! Let me know how it goes or if there's anything else you'd like to tweak.
