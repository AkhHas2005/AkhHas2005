Certainly! To add a custom component that is a copy of an existing one in Power Apps, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Component Library**:
   - Go to the **Apps** section in Power Apps.
   - Choose **Component Libraries** and click the **Create component library** button.
   - Give your component library a name and click **Create**.
   - The component library opens in studio mode, where you can create components.

2. **Import an Existing Component**:
   - If you've already made components in other apps, you can import them:
     - Go to **File** in the top menu and select **Settings**.
     - Under **Upcoming Features**, click the **Retired** tab and turn on **Export and import components**.
     - Now, the three dots symbol will appear next to the new component button.
     - Click the dots and select **Import components**.
     - Choose the app where the components you want to import are stored[^1^][1].

3. **Create a Copy of the Component**:
   - Once you have the component library, you can create a copy of an existing component inside your current app:
     - Select the component you want to copy.
     - Click **Edit component**.
     - Choose **Create a copy**.
     - The component will be copied to your local app under the **Custom** category in the Insert pane[^2^][2].

Now you can reuse and customize your components efficiently! Let me know if you need further assistance. ðŸ˜Š

## Me
I enabled "export and import components" but the 3 dots still aren't showing. How can I import my component from my app to the cpomponent library in power apps?  

## Co-Pilot
I apologize for any inconvenience you're experiencing. It seems that the three dots for importing components aren't appearing as expected. Let's troubleshoot this:

1. **Refresh the Page**:
   - Sometimes a simple refresh can resolve UI glitches. Try refreshing the Power Apps Studio page and see if the three dots appear.

2. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to import components. You should be an app owner or have sufficient privileges.
   - Also, verify that you're working within the correct environment.

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Cached data might cause issues. Clear your browser cache and try again.

4. **Try a Different Browser**:
   - Sometimes browser-specific issues occur. If you're using one browser, try a different one (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

5. **Contact Support**:
   - If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Power Apps support for further assistance.

Remember, importing components should be straightforward once the feature is enabled. If none of the above steps work, consider reporting this as a bug to Microsoft. ðŸ˜Š  

## Me
Is there an alternative way to import components?  

## Co-Pilot
Certainly! If the three dots for importing components aren't showing, you can try the following alternative approach:

1. **Export the Component**:
   - Open the app where your component is located.
   - Select the component you want to export.
   - Click **File** in the top menu and choose **Export component**.
   - Save the exported .msapp file to your local storage.

2. **Import into Component Library**:
   - Go back to your component library.
   - Click the three dots next to the new component button.
   - Select **Import components**.
   - Choose the .msapp file you exported earlier.

3. **Test and Use**:
   - Once imported, you can use the component in other apps by referencing your component library.

This method should help you get your component into the library. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
