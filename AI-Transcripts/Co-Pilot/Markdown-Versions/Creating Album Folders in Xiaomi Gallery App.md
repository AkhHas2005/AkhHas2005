Creating album folders in the Gallery app on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 5G is quite straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Open the Gallery app** on your phone.
2. **Tap on the "Albums" tab** at the bottom of the screen.
3. **Tap on the "Add" button** (usually represented by a "+" icon) to create a new album.
4. **Enter a name** for your new album and tap "OK".
5. **Select the photos or videos** you want to add to this album.
6. **Tap on "Save"** to finalize the creation of your new album[^1^][2].

This will create a new album that you can find under the "Albums" section, alongside the default ones in the "Other Albums" section.

I want to create an Album folder that can group multiple albums together

Unfortunately, the default Gallery app on Xiaomi devices doesn't support creating folders that can group multiple albums together. However, you can use third-party apps that offer more advanced album management features. Here are a couple of options:

1. **Google Photos**:
   - Download and install Google Photos from the Play Store.
   - Open Google Photos and sign in with your Google account.
   - Create albums and use the "Library" tab to organize them.

2. **Simple Gallery**:
   - Download and install Simple Gallery from the Play Store.
   - Open Simple Gallery and grant the necessary permissions.
   - Use the app's folder management features to create and organize albums.

These apps provide more flexibility and might better suit your needs for organizing your photos and albums.

Would you like more details on how to use any of these apps?
