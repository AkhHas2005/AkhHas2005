Certainly! To create a dynamic dependent drop-down list in Excel, you can use the new dynamic array functions available in Excel 365 and Excel 2021. Here's how:

1. **Get items for the main drop-down list**:
   - Suppose you have a list of fruit names in column A. Use the `UNIQUE` function to extract unique fruit names from column A. For example:
     ```
     =UNIQUE(A3:A15)
     ```
   - This formula goes into cell G3, and the results will spill into subsequent cells automatically.

2. **Create the main drop-down**:
   - Select a cell where you want the primary drop-down to appear (e.g., D3).
   - Go to the **Data** tab, click **Data Validation** in the **Data Tools** group.
   - In the **Data Validation** dialog box:
     - Under **Allow**, select **List**.
     - In the **Source** box, enter the reference to the spill range output by the `UNIQUE` formula[^1^][4].

Now, when you select a fruit from the main drop-down, the dependent drop-down will show relevant exporters based on your selection. Remember that this dynamic array approach works only in Excel 365 and Excel 2021. For older versions, you'll need to follow a different method[^1^][4].

Certainly! You can format text across multiple lines in a single cell in Excel using the following methods:

1. **Insert Line Breaks**:
   - Select the cell where you want to create multiple lines (e.g., Cell B5).
   - In the formula bar, type your text and press `Alt + Enter` to add a line break within the same cell.
   - Adjust the cell height by double-clicking the bottom bar of the corresponding row number to ensure both lines are visible[^1^][4].

2. **Wrap Text**:
   - Select the cell (e.g., Cell B6).
   - Go to the **Home** tab and click **Wrap Text** in the **Alignment** group.
   - This will display the content on two lines within the cell[^2^][5].

3. **Create a Line Break After a Specific Character**:
   - Insert a comma (", ") after the first part of your text (e.g., "John, Class 5").
   - Press `Ctrl + H` to open the **Find and Replace** window.
   - In the **Find what** box, enter a comma (", ").
   - In the **Replace with** box, press `Ctrl + J` to represent a line break.
   - Click **Replace All** and adjust the row height as needed[^1^][4].

4. **Merge & Center** (for two lines only):
   - Type your text in two adjacent cells (e.g., A1 and B1).
   - Select both cells, right-click, and choose **Format Cells**.
   - In the **Alignment** tab, select **Merge cells** and **Center across selection**.
   - This will create two lines within a single cell[^1^][4].

Feel free to choose the method that best suits your needs! ðŸ˜Š
