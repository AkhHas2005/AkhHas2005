Certainly! Creating a mailing list in Gmail is a handy way to streamline your communication with specific groups of contacts. Let's get you sorted out:

1. **Open Google Contacts**:
   - First, fire up your web browser and head over to Google Contacts.
   - Remember, in typical Google fashion, all your Gmail contacts are managed through this separate app.

2. **Select Contacts for Your List**:
   - Hover over the contact you want to add to your mailing list.
   - Click the checkbox next to each contact you'd like to include.
   - Make sure each contact has an associated email address; otherwise, they won't appear in your list when you go to email them later.

3. **Create a Label**:
   - Click on the "Label" icon (it looks like a tag) and then select "Create Label."
   - Give your label a memorable name (something like "Book Club" or "Project Team").
   - Click "Save" to create your contact list.

4. **Adding Contacts to an Existing Label**:
   - If you want to add contacts to an already existing label, select the contact, click the "Label" icon, choose the label you want to add it to, and then click "Apply."

5. **Compose Your Email**:
   - Now that you have your list created and labeled, head back to your Gmail inbox.
   - Click the "+" icon (usually located in the lower-right corner) and select "Compose" to start a new email.
   - Begin typing the name of the label you created. Gmail will suggest it below the text field.
   - Fill out your email content.
   - Click "Send" when you're ready to dispatch your message to everyone in the group list.

Remember, while this is great for personal use or small-scale communication, free Google accounts have a limit of up to 500 sent and received emails per day. So, if you're planning a massive email campaign, you might want to consider other tools or services.

Happy emailing! ðŸ“§âœ¨[^1^][1] [^2^][2] [^3^][3]

What is a password encryption method I can use in python to store encrypted/hashed passwords?

Certainly! When it comes to securely storing passwords in Python, you have a few reliable options. Let me introduce you to a couple of popular methods:

1. **bcrypt**:
   - **bcrypt** is a widely used password-hashing library that provides a strong level of security. It not only hashes the password but also incorporates a salt (random data) to enhance security.
   - To use bcrypt, you'll need to install it first. You can do this using pip:
     ```python
     pip install bcrypt
     ```
   - Once installed, here's how you can hash a password using bcrypt:
     ```python
     import bcrypt

     password = "mypasswordstring"
     # Encode the password into a readable utf-8 byte code:
     password_encoded = password.encode('utf-8')
     # Hash the encoded password and generate a salt:
     hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password_encoded, bcrypt.gensalt())
     ```
   - The `hashed_password` will be a securely hashed version of your original password. You can store this in your database.

2. **passlib**:
   - **passlib** is another excellent library for password hashing. It provides a high-level interface and supports various hashing algorithms.
   - First, you'll need to install it:
     ```python
     pip install passlib
     ```
   - Next, create a **CryptContext** object to manage your password hashing:
     ```python
     from passlib.context import CryptContext

     pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
     ```
   - Now you can use the following functions to encrypt and verify passwords:
     ```python
     def encrypt_password(password):
         return pwd_context.encrypt(password)

     def check_encrypted_password(password, hashed):
         return pwd_context.verify(password, hashed)
     ```
     - The `encrypt_password` function will hash your password, and the `check_encrypted_password` function will verify whether a given password matches the stored hash.

3. **maskpass** (for hiding passwords during input):
   - If you want to hide passwords during user input (e.g., in a terminal-based application), you can use the **maskpass** module.
   - Install it with:
     ```python
     pip install maskpass
     ```
   - Example usage:
     ```python
     import maskpass

     # Hide password during input (no echo):
     pwd = maskpass.askpass(mask="")
     print(pwd)

     # Or mask with a specific character (e.g., hashtag):
     pwd = maskpass.askpass(prompt="Password:", mask="#")
     print(pwd)
     ```
     - In the second example, the user's password will be echoed in the prompt but hidden with hashtags (#).

Remember, always choose a strong hashing method and never store plain-text passwords. These libraries handle the complexities of secure password storage, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”’

Explain how to do this in Python?  
```

Use the method .copy() to initialise w with the values of w0
```

## Co-Pilot
[1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html ""
[2]: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_copy.asp ""
[3]: https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-copy-list/ ""
[4]: https://diveintopython.org/functions/list-methods/copy ""
[5]: https://realpython.com/copying-python-objects/ ""

To initialize `w` with the values of `w0` using the `.copy()` method in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure `w0` is a list or dictionary**: The `.copy()` method is available for lists and dictionaries in Python.

2. **Use the `.copy()` method**: This method creates a shallow copy of the list or dictionary, meaning it copies the structure but not the nested objects.

Here's an example for both a list and a dictionary:

### For a List
```python
# Original list
w0 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a copy of w0
w = w0.copy()

# Now w is a separate list with the same values as w0
print(w)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### For a Dictionary
```python
# Original dictionary
w0 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# Create a copy of w0
w = w0.copy()

# Now w is a separate dictionary with the same key-value pairs as w0
print(w)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

### Important Notes
- **Shallow Copy**: The `.copy()` method creates a shallow copy. If your list or dictionary contains other mutable objects (like other lists or dictionaries), those objects are not copied. Instead, references to the original objects are included in the new list or dictionary.
- **Deep Copy**: If you need to copy nested objects as well, you should use the `copy.deepcopy()` method from the `copy` module.

### Example of Deep Copy
```python
import copy

# Original nested list
w0 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# Create a deep copy of w0
w = copy.deepcopy(w0)

# Now w is a completely separate list with the same nested values as w0
print(w)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
