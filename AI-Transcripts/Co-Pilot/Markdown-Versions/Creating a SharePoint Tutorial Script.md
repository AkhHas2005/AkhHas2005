**[Intro]**

*Hi everyone, welcome to our SharePoint tutorial. Today, we’re going to dive into the concept and importance of SharePoint pages within our organization. Let’s get started!*

**[Section 1: What Are SharePoint Pages?]**

*Firstly, think of a SharePoint page as similar to a webpage. Just like on a regular website, SharePoint allows us to have a landing page and subpages. Some of these subpages can be accessed through the navigation bar, making it a very intuitive and familiar concept.*

**[Section 2: The Benefits of Using SharePoint Pages]**

*SharePoint pages are not just about organizing information. They allow us to create managed webpages that can link to documents within our site and integrate seamlessly with Microsoft widgets. This means we can bring in calendars, lists, task trackers, and more, right into our pages.*

*Furthermore, SharePoint pages are a fantastic way to communicate ideas and information to your team. They offer the ability to share content using images, Excel, Word and PowerPoint documents, videos, and more, making them incredibly versatile.*

**[Section 3: Ease of Creation and Accessibility]**

*One of the best features of SharePoint pages is how quickly and easily we can create and publish them. No need for advanced technical skills—just a few clicks, and we’re set. And the best part? They look great on any device, whether it’s a computer, tablet, or smartphone.*

**[Closing]**

*In summary, SharePoint pages are powerful tools that help us manage and share information efficiently. They keep our teams informed, engaged, and connected. So, let’s make the most of this incredible resource!*

*Thanks for watching, and don’t forget to check out our other SharePoint tutorials. Happy sharing!*

How about for SharePoint lists?  
These are my notes, feel free to add extra information that's relevant:  
- A list is a collection of data, similar to an Excel Spreadsheet that you can share with your team members and people who you've provided access to.
- It can be added to the navigation panel of the SharePoint site and can be especially useful for processes like the Spend Efficiency Panel
- The most common advantage is that they are rich and flexible and have many built-in features that provide a robust way to store, share, and work with data.
- You can create forms directly from teh sharePoint list and when someone submits teh form, it automatically populates teh list
