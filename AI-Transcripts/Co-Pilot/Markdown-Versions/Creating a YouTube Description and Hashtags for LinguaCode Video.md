# Creating a YouTube Description and Hashtags for LinguaCode Video  

## Me
I'm currently uploading a new YouTube channel for my Python channel with the title 
"Showcasing my Structured English coding language (LinguaCode) #pythonprogrammer #codinglanguage "  
How can I write a description for it similar to this:  

```
Welcome back to the AI Apps Challenge 2025! It‚Äôs been an exciting four months, and I‚Äôm thrilled to share my progress so far.
In this video, I‚Äôll showcase the completed projects from April, May, and June ‚Äî covering everything from an
AI-powered document extraction tool to a job ad generator, and even a new version of the AI Cover Letter Writer.

I‚Äôll also give you a look at the in-progress and almost completed AI Speech-to-Text App, the project for July.
Watch as I demo the current functionality, including Voice recording uploads, AI Transcription Summaries, and preliminary trascript exporting.
The journey has been intense, but seeing these apps come to life has been incredibly rewarding.

Stay tuned for updates on what‚Äôs coming next, and don‚Äôt forget to check out the GitHub repo for more details on the code and progress!
```  

Also how can I do a hashtags secyion similar to this but for th etopics in my current video: 

Hashtags:  
#programming #pythonprogrammer #pythonprojectswithsourcecode #aiapplications #aiappschallenge2025 #gemini #hasai #coding #july2025 #2025challenge

Absolutely, Hasan ‚Äî let‚Äôs craft a compelling YouTube description that matches your tone and structure, while spotlighting LinguaCode and your Python expertise. Here's a tailored version:

### üìπ Description

Welcome to my latest Python dev update! In this video, I‚Äôm excited to introduce **LinguaCode**, a structured English-style coding language I‚Äôve been developing to make programming more intuitive and readable ‚Äî especially for beginners and non-native English speakers.

You‚Äôll see how LinguaCode translates natural language-like syntax into functional Python code, and how it can be used to build real-world applications with clarity and precision. I‚Äôll walk through the core design principles, demo a few examples, and share the motivation behind creating a language that bridges the gap between human thought and machine logic.

This project has been a passion piece ‚Äî blending my love for clean syntax, automation, and accessibility. Whether you're a seasoned Pythonista or just curious about alternative coding paradigms, I hope LinguaCode sparks some ideas for how we can rethink how we teach and write code.

üîó Check out the GitHub repo for source code, documentation, and ongoing updates!

Would you like help writing a pinned comment or GitHub README to go with it? Or maybe a visual metaphor to explain LinguaCode‚Äôs syntax philosophy?
