# Creative Map Ideas for Fortnite Livestream  

## Me
I'm building a map in UEFN (Fortnite creative 2.0), what could be some cool and interesting ideas for the map for my livestream on YouTube  

## Co-Pilot
That sounds like a lot of fun! Here are some cool and interesting ideas for your map:

1. **Mystery Adventure**: Create a map filled with puzzles, hidden treasures, and secret passages. Players can work together to solve riddles and uncover the map's mysteries.
2. **Survival Challenge**: Design a map where players must survive in a harsh environment, gathering resources, building shelters, and defending against waves of enemies.
3. **Prop Hunt**: Hide various props around the map, and players must find and collect them within a time limit. You can add twists like decoy props and special power-ups.
4. **Build Wars**: Set up a map where players compete in building challenges, such as creating the tallest structure or the most elaborate fortification within a time limit.
5. **Zombie Escape**: Create a map where players must escape from a horde of zombies, using their building skills to create barriers and traps to slow down the zombies.
6. **Theme Park**: Build a fun and interactive theme park with various rides, games, and attractions. Players can explore the park, complete challenges, and collect rewards.
7. **Time Travel Adventure**: Design a map that takes players through different historical eras, with each area featuring unique challenges and enemies from that time period.
8. **Underwater World**: Create an underwater map with hidden treasures, underwater creatures, and challenges that require players to use their building skills to navigate the depths.
9. **Sky City**: Build a floating city in the sky, with platforms, bridges, and obstacles that players must traverse to reach the top.
10. **Fortnite x Minecraft**: Combine elements from both games to create a unique crossover map, featuring Minecraft-style blocks and structures in the Fortnite world.

These ideas should keep your viewers entertained and engaged during your livestream. Which one do you think you'll try first?
