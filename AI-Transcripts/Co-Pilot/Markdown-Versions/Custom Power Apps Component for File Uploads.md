You can find custom Power Apps components that allow file uploads in a few places:

1. **Power Apps Component Library**: This is a centralized repository where you can create, share, and reuse components across different apps. You can create a new component library or edit an existing one to include file upload functionality[^1^][5].

2. **Power Apps 911**: They offer tutorials and solutions for various Power Apps functionalities, including file uploads. You can follow their step-by-step guide to create a custom file upload component[^2^][1].

3. **Microsoft Learn**: The Attachments control in Power Apps allows users to upload and delete files from a list or a Dataverse table. This control can be customized to fit your needs[^3^][2].

4. **Matthew Devaney's Blog**: He provides detailed instructions on creating and importing components into a Power Apps component library. This includes enabling the import feature for components[^4^][3].

Would you like more detailed instructions on any of these options?
