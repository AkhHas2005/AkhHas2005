# DNS Resolution Error Fix

## Me
How can I resolve this error: Configuration is not authorised on pythonprogrammertutorials.me.

## Co-Pilot
The error you're encountering seems related to DNS resolution. Specifically, it's trying to read `/etc/resolv.conf`, which doesn't exist in your environment. To work around this issue, you can add the following code snippet at the beginning of your Python script:

```python
import dns.resolver
dns.resolver.default_resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver(configure=False)
dns.resolver.default_resolver.nameservers = ['8.8.8.8']
```

This will set up a custom DNS resolver with Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8) and should allow your MongoDB connection to proceed without encountering the "Resolver configuration could not be read or specified no nameservers" error¬π. Give it a try, and let me know if you need further assistance! üòä

## Me
I am trying to deploy a widget from an Agent Builder in Google cloud console but I keep getting this  error when I try to use it on my website: Configuration is not authorised on pythonprogrammertutorials.me.

The error message "Configuration is not authorised on pythonprogrammertutorials.me" suggests that there might be an issue with the authorization or configuration settings for your widget deployment. Let's troubleshoot this step by step:

1. **Check Your Domain Configuration:**
   Ensure that your domain (`pythonprogrammertutorials.me`) is correctly configured in your Google Cloud Console project. Verify that you've set up the necessary DNS records (such as A, CNAME, or TXT records) to point to the correct IP address or hostname where your widget is hosted.

2. **Verify API Key and Credentials:**
   If your widget requires an API key or other credentials (such as OAuth tokens), double-check that you've provided the correct ones. Make sure the API key is authorized to access the necessary resources (e.g., Google Maps API, Firebase, etc.).

3. **Check CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Settings:**
   Cross-origin requests can sometimes cause issues. Ensure that your widget's server (where it's hosted) allows requests from your website's domain (`pythonprogrammertutorials.me`). You can configure CORS settings on your server to allow specific origins.

4. **Inspect Network Requests:**
   Use your browser's developer tools to inspect network requests when loading the widget on your website. Look for any failed requests or CORS-related errors. This will help you identify the specific issue.

5. **Review Widget Configuration:**
   Within the Agent Builder, review the widget's configuration settings. Make sure you've specified the correct endpoints, URLs, and any other relevant parameters.

6. **Test Locally:**
   If possible, test the widget locally (on your development machine) to ensure it works as expected. This will help you isolate any issues related to the widget itself.

7. **Check Server Logs:**
   Check the logs on your server where the widget is hosted. Look for any error messages or warnings related to authorization or configuration.

Remember that troubleshooting can be iterative, so take it step by step. If you encounter any specific errors or need further assistance, feel free to share additional details, and I'll be happy to assist! üòäüîç
