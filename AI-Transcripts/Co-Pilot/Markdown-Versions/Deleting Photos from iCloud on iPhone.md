How can I delete photos stored in iCloud on my iPhone?

To delete photos stored in iCloud on your iPhone, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Photos app** on your iPhone.[1]
2. **Select the photo(s)** you want to delete.[1]
3. **Tap the Trash button** (it looks like a trash can) and then tap **Delete Photo**.[1]
4. **Go to the Recently Deleted album** (you can find it under Utilities when you swipe up in the Photos app).[1]
5. **Select the photo(s)** you want to permanently delete and tap **Delete**.[1]
