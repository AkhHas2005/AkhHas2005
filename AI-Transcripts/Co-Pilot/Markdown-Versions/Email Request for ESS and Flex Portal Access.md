Based on this:  
Hi all   
Just a couple of things with regards to general house-keeping:  

Calendars - please keep your personal outlook calendar and the Application & Systems Support Calendar 
updated with your whereabouts e.g. leave, working from home, unavailable slots etc  
Working from home on one of the usual office days (Tuesday or Thursday). - 
If you know in advance that you need to work from home on one of these days please email me your request with as much notice as possible, 
including a brief explanation of why the request is being made. I will always try to accommodate these requests, 
especially as you consistently provide flexibility and commitment in your roles. 
I do need to keep a record of why I‚Äôve authorised any changes to our usual working arrangements though, which is why I‚Äôm requesting a written request. 
I will authorise your request by responding to your email. Once authorised please mark in your outlook calendars that you are working from home.  
I appreciate that unexpected things crop up for all of us, and in those cases, just let me know as soon as you can. 
In these cases a request can then be retrospectively submitted.  

Any queries give me a shout.  
Thanks  

How can I send an email to my manager notifying him that I'll be working from home on Thursday. My reasons are teh following:  
- There's nothing in-person going on and so I think I would be better completing my work at home, I also don't need to liase with any other team members
- Bus journeys cost me ¬£5 every time I come to teh office (both ways)
- I don't have anything else going on that I need to leave the house for so I would prefer to stay at home  

Keep teh email polite and professional and rephrase those reasons that I said according to this tone, 
keep in mind that I already messaged him, this si just to keep things professional and chartered  

## Co-Pilot
Absolutely, Hasan. Here's a polished and professional email that aligns with the tone of the original message and respectfully communicates your reasons:

**Subject:** Working from Home ‚Äì Thursday Request

Hi [Manager's Name],

Following up on my earlier message, I‚Äôd like to formally request to work from home this Thursday.

There are no in-person meetings or collaborative tasks scheduled that require me to be on-site, and I‚Äôm confident I can complete my work effectively from home. Additionally, given the travel costs involved and the fact that I have no other commitments requiring me to be out, working remotely would be the more practical option for the day.

Please let me know if you're happy to authorise this, and I‚Äôll update my Outlook calendar accordingly.

Best regards,  
Hasan

Let me know if you'd like to adjust the tone slightly‚Äîmore casual or more formal‚Äîor if you want to include specific tasks you'll be working on that day.

**Subject:** Working from Home ‚Äì Tuesday Request

Hi [Manager's Name],

I‚Äôd like to request to work from home next Tuesday.

As with Thursday, there are no in-person meetings or collaborative requirements that would necessitate being in the office, and I believe I can work more efficiently from home. It also helps reduce travel costs, and I don‚Äôt have any other commitments that require me to be out that day.

Please let me know if you're happy to authorise this, and I‚Äôll update my calendar accordingly.

Best regards,  
Hasan

If you‚Äôd like to combine both requests into one email or add a note about what you‚Äôll be working on, I can help with that too.

How can I send an email based on this email conversation [Uploaded Document Expired] to finance about the issue and to explain why the spreadsheet changes have been approved?

**Subject:** Spend Panel Issue ‚Äì Spreadsheet Updates and Approval Context

Hi [Finance Team / specific name if known],

I‚Äôm writing to provide an update regarding the recent issue raised by Juliet Alika concerning the Spend Panel submission process.

After investigating with the App Support Team, we identified that the error stemmed from inconsistencies between the Team/Unit names listed in the submission form and those in the associated spreadsheet. Specifically, the Excel Connector was unable to match abbreviated or slightly altered names, which caused the flow to fail and prevented requests from reaching the budget manager.

To resolve this, I reviewed the spreadsheet and made updates to the Team/Unit names to ensure consistency with the form inputs. **No changes were made to budget manager names**, in line with the guidance from Denise Wilson that such edits must be confirmed by finance.

These changes have now been implemented in the live version following access approval from James Hobson. The flow has since resumed functioning correctly, and Juliet‚Äôs request is now processing as expected.

Please let me know if you‚Äôd like a summary of the specific edits made or if any further validation is required from your side.

Best regards,

  - No approval flow triggered
  - Multiple failed submissions despite correct cost code and budget manager selection
- **Root Cause:**

   - Identified and documented rows with mismatched Team/Unit names.
