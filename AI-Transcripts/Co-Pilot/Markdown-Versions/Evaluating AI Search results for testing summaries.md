# Evaluating AI Search results for testing summaries  

## Me
The screenshot png is the outcome of a test of the AI search and the following paragraph contains the information that should be pulled to the search to generate the AI summary.  
Can you provide a brief summary of how well the search worked for the question "What are the different types of commitments?" for my software testing report?  
Information for search:  
When you select â€˜Contractsâ€™ on the Navigator, it takes you to the Contract Navigation Tree.  
This is a list of all Contract Types in ContrOCC.  
You can expand a Contract Type by clicking on the + to the left, to reveal individual  
Contracts.  
If you click on the + to the left of a Contract, you can see the services and commitments linked to the provider.  
A contract reference must be unique (follow individual team guidance).  
Providers for non CLA payments are not linked to an LCS provider.  
Each Contract Type is configured to meet specific requirements and payment terms.  
Contracts have many of their payment terms automatically generated based on the configuration of the Contract Type.  
Finance Officers, Authorisation Officers and Finalisation Officers only have access to the Contracts relevant to their job role.  
The System Team and App Support have access to all Contracts for system management purposes.  
The following icons are used in the Contract Navigation Tree: 2  
Services and Service Levels  
Service Levels are single types of care/costs paid to a provider. In ContrOCC, they are used to create the cost Care Packages for LCS. To view existing and available Service Levels, use the Delivery tab in ContrOCC. Only Service Levels in the Service Delivery tab will be able to be commissioned in LCS.  
Spot Commitments (client specific)  
Spot Commitments are the most common type of commitment. Spot Commitments are created when Service Levels are assigned. Spot Commitments become CPLIs (Care Package Line Items) and allow the cost packages/service levels to be selected in LCS.  
Block Commitments (client & provider specific)  
Block Commitments can be used to block the use of something, for example, reserving beds in a Residential Home, or, to pay the carer fees. Blocked beds are provider specific until a young person is placed.  
Value Commitments  
Value Commitments are provider specific and are used to pay a provider for costs not linked to a specific child, for example, if the provider is being reimbursed for attending a training course.

Certainly! Let's summarize the different types of commitments based on the information you provided. Here are the key points:

1. **Spot Commitments (Client Specific):**
   - These are the most common type of commitment.
   - Spot Commitments are created when Service Levels are assigned.
   - They become CPLIs (Care Package Line Items) and allow the selection of cost packages or service levels in LCS.

2. **Block Commitments (Client & Provider Specific):**
   - Block Commitments are used to block the use of something.
   - For example, they can reserve beds in a Residential Home or pay carer fees.
   - Blocked beds are provider-specific until a young person is placed.

3. **Value Commitments:**
   - These are provider-specific.
   - They are used to pay a provider for costs not directly linked to a specific child.
   - For instance, reimbursement for attending a training course.

Remember that understanding these commitment types is crucial for effective management and resource allocation. If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š[^1^][7]

Certainly! Let's summarize the AI search functionality based on the provided screenshot and the relevant information:

1. **Budget Codes for the Trust and ContrOCC:**
   - Budget codes for the Trust start with the letter "C."
   - In ContrOCC, budget codes start with the letter "R" but are converted to "C" in Middleware.
   - Finance Officers may use "C" in their communication.
   - To align with the Trust's coding system, replace the "R" with "C" in the codes provided.

2. **Specific Budget Codes:**
   - Child in Care: Original code RDHG (Through Care Leavers) becomes CDHG.
   - Through Care University: Original code RFJF (Care Leavers) becomes CFJF.
   - Keighley & Shipley Assessment: Original code RHIX (Care Management) becomes CHIX.
   - MASH team: Original code RHIW (MASH) becomes CHIW.
   - Independent Fostering Agency: Original code RDFY (Placement Coordination) becomes CDFY.
   - And so on for other codes.

Remember to apply this conversion consistently to ensure accurate budget tracking. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š[^1^][7]
