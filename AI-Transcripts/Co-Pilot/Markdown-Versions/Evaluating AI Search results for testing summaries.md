# Evaluating AI Search results for testing summaries  

## Me
The screenshot png is the outcome of a test of the AI search and the following paragraph contains the information that should be pulled to the search to generate the AI summary.  
Can you provide a brief summary of how well the search worked for the question "What are the different types of commitments?" for my software testing report?  
Information for search:  
When you select â€˜Contractsâ€™ on the Navigator, it takes you to the Contract Navigation Tree.  
This is a list of all Contract Types in ContrOCC.  
You can expand a Contract Type by clicking on the + to the left, to reveal individual  
Contracts.  
If you click on the + to the left of a Contract, you can see the services and commitments linked to the provider.  
A contract reference must be unique (follow individual team guidance).  
Providers for non CLA payments are not linked to an LCS provider.  
Each Contract Type is configured to meet specific requirements and payment terms.  
Contracts have many of their payment terms automatically generated based on the configuration of the Contract Type.  
Finance Officers, Authorisation Officers and Finalisation Officers only have access to the Contracts relevant to their job role.  
The System Team and App Support have access to all Contracts for system management purposes.  
The following icons are used in the Contract Navigation Tree: 2  
Services and Service Levels  
Service Levels are single types of care/costs paid to a provider. In ContrOCC, they are used to create the cost Care Packages for LCS. To view existing and available Service Levels, use the Delivery tab in ContrOCC. Only Service Levels in the Service Delivery tab will be able to be commissioned in LCS.  
Spot Commitments (client specific)  
Spot Commitments are the most common type of commitment. Spot Commitments are created when Service Levels are assigned. Spot Commitments become CPLIs (Care Package Line Items) and allow the cost packages/service levels to be selected in LCS.  
Block Commitments (client & provider specific)  
Block Commitments can be used to block the use of something, for example, reserving beds in a Residential Home, or, to pay the carer fees. Blocked beds are provider specific until a young person is placed.  
Value Commitments  
Value Commitments are provider specific and are used to pay a provider for costs not linked to a specific child, for example, if the provider is being reimbursed for attending a training course.

Explain how to do this in Python?  
```

Use the method .copy() to initialise w with the values of w0
```

## Co-Pilot
[1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html ""
[2]: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_copy.asp ""
[3]: https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-copy-list/ ""
[4]: https://diveintopython.org/functions/list-methods/copy ""
[5]: https://realpython.com/copying-python-objects/ ""

To initialize `w` with the values of `w0` using the `.copy()` method in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure `w0` is a list or dictionary**: The `.copy()` method is available for lists and dictionaries in Python.

2. **Use the `.copy()` method**: This method creates a shallow copy of the list or dictionary, meaning it copies the structure but not the nested objects.

Here's an example for both a list and a dictionary:

### For a List
```python
# Original list
w0 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a copy of w0
w = w0.copy()

# Now w is a separate list with the same values as w0
print(w)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### For a Dictionary
```python
# Original dictionary
w0 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# Create a copy of w0
w = w0.copy()

# Now w is a separate dictionary with the same key-value pairs as w0
print(w)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

### Important Notes
- **Shallow Copy**: The `.copy()` method creates a shallow copy. If your list or dictionary contains other mutable objects (like other lists or dictionaries), those objects are not copied. Instead, references to the original objects are included in the new list or dictionary.
- **Deep Copy**: If you need to copy nested objects as well, you should use the `copy.deepcopy()` method from the `copy` module.

### Example of Deep Copy
```python
import copy

# Original nested list
w0 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# Create a deep copy of w0
w = copy.deepcopy(w0)

# Now w is a completely separate list with the same nested values as w0
print(w)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
