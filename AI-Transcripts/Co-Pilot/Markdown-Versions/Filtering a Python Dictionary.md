# Filtering a Python Dictionary  

## Me
I have a dictionary in python. How can I filter the dictionary so that any key-value pairs with a value of 2 or more are removed and the remaining keys are put into an ordered list?

Certainly! To filter a dictionary in Python and keep only the key-value pairs where the value is less than 2, you can use a list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 2, 'd': 0}

# Filter out key-value pairs with value >= 2
filtered_dict = {key: value for key, value in my_dict.items() if value < 2}

# Get the keys as an ordered list
ordered_keys = list(filtered_dict.keys())

print(ordered_keys)
```

This code snippet will create a new dictionary `filtered_dict` containing only the key-value pairs with values less than 2, and then extract the keys into an ordered list. Feel free to replace `my_dict` with your own dictionary! ðŸ˜Š [^1^][1]
