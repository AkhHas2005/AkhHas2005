That sounds like an exciting project! Your title is off to a great start. How about something like:

**"Epic Football Moments: Live from 2013-2024"**

Or if you want to emphasize the personal aspect:

**"My Top Live Football Moments: 2013-2024"**

These titles highlight the timeframe and the fact that these are moments you personally witnessed, which can make your video more engaging for viewers. What do you think? Do you have any specific moments in mind that you'll be including?

Absolutely, I'd be happy to help! Here are some alternative titles that might catch more attention on YouTube:

1. **"500 Sub Special: My Top Live Football Moments (2013-2024)"**
2. **"Epic Live Football Moments: 500 Sub Special (2013-2024)"**
3. **"500 Subs Celebration: Best Football Moments I've Witnessed Live"**
4. **"Unforgettable Live Football Moments: 500 Sub Milestone"**
5. **"500 Subs Special: Greatest Live Football Highlights (2013-2024)"**

These titles emphasize the milestone of reaching 500 subscribers while also highlighting the personal and memorable aspect of the moments you've witnessed. Do any of these resonate with you?
