# GitHub Desktop Error: Proxy Authentication Issue

## Me
How can I fix this error on github desktop? Cloning into 'C:\Users\HasanAkh1\Documents\GitHub\BCFT-AI'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/HasanBradfordUni/BCFT-AI.git/': CONNECT tunnel failed, response 407 

## Co-Pilot
The error message you're encountering indicates an issue with proxy authentication. Let's troubleshoot this:

1. **Check Proxy Settings:**
    - First, ensure that your proxy settings are correctly configured in Git. You can do this by running the following commands in your Git Bash or terminal:
        ```
        git config --global http.proxy http://<username>:<userpsw>@<proxy>:<port>
        git config --global https.proxy http://<username>:<userpsw>@<proxy>:<port>
        ```
        Replace `<username>`, `<userpsw>`, `<proxy>`, and `<port>` with your actual proxy details.

2. **SSL Verification:**
    - Sometimes SSL verification can cause issues. You can disable it using:
        ```
        git config --global http.sslVerify false
        ```
        Note that this step is necessary; otherwise, you might encounter an "SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate" error.

3. **Clone Using HTTP Instead of HTTPS:**
    - Try cloning using the HTTP URL instead of HTTPS. Update your remote URL like this:
        ```
        git remote set-url origin http://github.com/HasanBradfordUni/BCFT-AI.git
        git clone http://github.com/HasanBradfordUni/BCFT-AI.git
        ```
        Replace the URL with the correct repository link.

4. **Restart Proxy Server (if applicable):**
    - If you're using a proxy server like CNTLM, try restarting it. Sometimes this resolves authentication issues.

Remember to replace placeholders with your actual values. If none of these steps work, consider checking your network configuration or contacting your IT department for further assistanceÂ¹Â². Good luck! ðŸš€

To resolve the "HTTP code 407" error when cloning a Git repository through a proxy, follow these steps:

1. **Proxy Configuration:**
    - First, you'll need to manually configure the proxy settings in Git. Open your Git Bash or terminal and run the following commands:
        ```
        git config --global http.proxy http://<username>:<userpsw>@<proxy>:<port>
        git config --global https.proxy http://<username>:<userpsw>@<proxy>:<port>
        ```
        Replace `<username>`, `<userpsw>`, `<proxy>`, and `<port>` with your actual proxy details.

2. **SSL Verification:**
    - Disable SSL verification (if necessary) using:
        ```
        git config --global http.sslVerify false
        ```
        This step is essential; otherwise, you might encounter an "SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate" error.

3. **Clone Using HTTP Instead of HTTPS:**
    - Try cloning using the HTTP URL instead of HTTPS. Update your remote URL like this:
        ```
        git remote set-url origin http://github.com/HasanBradfordUni/BCFT-AI.git
        git clone http://github.com/HasanBradfordUni/BCFT-AI.git
        ```

4. **Restart Proxy Server (if applicable):**
    - If you're using a proxy server like CNTLM, restart it. Sometimes this resolves authentication issues.

## Co-Pilot
Certainly! When configuring the proxy settings in Git, you'll need to replace the placeholders with your actual values:

1. `<username>`: Your proxy username (if required).
2. `<userpsw>`: Your proxy password (if required).
3. `<proxy>`: The proxy server address (e.g., `proxy.example.com`).
4. `<port>`: The port number for the proxy (usually 80 or 8080).

Make sure to obtain these details from your network administrator or IT department. Once you have the correct information, replace the placeholders in the commands you provided. Good luck! ðŸš€
