No, gorillas are not monkeys. Gorillas belong to a different group of primates known as **apes**. This group also includes humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gibbons[^1^][1][^2^][2]. 

Here are some key differences:
- **Classification**: Gorillas are classified as apes in the family Hominidae, while monkeys belong to various other families within the primate order[^2^][2].
- **Physical Traits**: Gorillas are generally larger and heavier than monkeys. They also lack tails, which most monkeys have[^3^][6].
- **Behavior**: Gorillas are predominantly ground-dwelling, whereas many monkeys are more arboreal (tree-dwelling)[^4^][5].
