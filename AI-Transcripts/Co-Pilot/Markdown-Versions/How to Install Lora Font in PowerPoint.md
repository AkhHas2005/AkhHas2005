# How to Install Lora Font in PowerPoint  

## Me
On PowerPoint I want to use the Lora font, however I can't find it anywhere in the app, how can I download it and import it into PowerPoint for usage?  

## Co-Pilot
Great choiceâ€”**Lora** is a beautiful serif font with a modern, elegant feel. Since itâ€™s not included by default in PowerPoint, youâ€™ll need to install it on your system first. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Download the font**:  
   Head over to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) or [1001 Fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/lora-font.html) and download the Lora font family. Itâ€™ll come in a ZIP file containing `.ttf` files for different styles (Regular, Italic, Bold, etc.).

2. **Install the font**:  
   - On **Windows**, right-click each `.ttf` file and select **Install** or **Install for all users**.  
   - On **Mac**, double-click the `.ttf` file and click **Install Font** in the preview window.

3. **Restart PowerPoint**:  
   Once installed, restart PowerPoint and you should see **Lora** in your font dropdown list.

Let me know if youâ€™d like help pairing it with a complementary font or designing a slide theme around it! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
