I've been at BCFT for over a month now (since July 17), and I'm thoroughly enjoying my time here. A big thanks to everyone, especially James Hobson and Kirsten Trenell, for their incredible support and guidance.

As my internship is ending soon on September 20th, I wanted to share some highlights:
- Engaged in extensive AI research and started developing some potential solutions.
- Gained a comprehensive overview of the organization, understanding how it operates and the crucial role of IT in a professional setting.

Overall, it's been a fantastic experience that I believe will greatly benefit my future endeavors.

To determine the RGB or hexadecimal color of the area circled in red in your image, you can use an online color picker tool. Here are a couple of options:

1. **RedKetchup Color Picker**: This tool allows you to upload your image and click on the specific area to get the color code in various formats, including HEX and RGB[^1^][6].
2. **Pixelied Image Color Picker**: Another user-friendly tool where you can upload your image and select the area to find the exact color code[^2^][7].

Simply upload your image to one of these tools, and you'll be able to pinpoint the exact color you're looking for. If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask!
