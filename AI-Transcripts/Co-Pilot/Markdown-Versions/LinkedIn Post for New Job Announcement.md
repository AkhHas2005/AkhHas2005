How does that work for you?  

## Me
Summarise this for my lecture notes:  
- The Independence Hypothesis…  
  - … makes computation possible.
  - … yields optimal classifiers when satisfied.
  - … but is seldom satisfied in practice, as attributes (variables) are often correlated.
- Attempts to overcome this limitation:
- Bayesian networks, that combine Bayesian reasoning with causal relationships between attributes.
- Decision trees, that reason on one attribute at the time, considering most important attributes first
- Should we trust data?
  - Outliers: Samples that cannot be classified into any known category
  - Missing values: mainly missing input features
  - Data imbalance: Disproportionate classes in the training set
  - Redundant Features: Features that can be obtained from each other, e.g. using a linear combination
- Accuracy metric (I have got 99% accuracy!!!) → Usually means overfitting → Accuracy on the test set will drop dramatically!
- Splitting: What’s the right training/test splitting ratio, 60/40, 70/30…  

## Co-Pilot
Here’s a brief summary for your lecture notes:

---

**The Independence Hypothesis**

- **Computation**: Makes it possible.
- **Optimal Classifiers**: Yields them when satisfied.
- **Practicality**: Seldom satisfied due to often correlated attributes (variables).

**Overcoming Limitations**:
- **Bayesian Networks**: Combine Bayesian reasoning with causal relationships.
- **Decision Trees**: Analyze one attribute at a time, prioritizing the most important ones first.

---

**Trusting Data Issues**:

- **Outliers**: Samples that can't be classified into any known category.
- **Missing Values**: Mainly missing input features.
- **Data Imbalance**: Disproportionate classes in the training set.
- **Redundant Features**: Features derivable from each other (e.g., linear combinations).

**Accuracy Metrics**:
- **Overfitting**: 99% accuracy typically indicates overfitting; test set accuracy drops dramatically.
- **Splitting Ratios**: Optimal training/test splitting ratios debated (60/40, 70/30…).

    Good afternoon,
    I hope this message finds you well. 
    I'm reaching out because you indicated that you need a reasonable adjustment in the application or assessment process for the Industrial Placement. 
    I would like to invite you to discuss your specific needs further, so we can better understand how to support you in your application.
    Here’s a brief overview of the assessment process: 
    Motivational Questions: 
    You will be asked to respond to several questions in a free text format. You’ll have 5 days to complete this, and you can use tools like Word to format your responses before pasting them into the application. 
    NRT (IP Finance): 
    You can add additional time before starting this assessment on your own. The tables and graphs are resizable and interactive, which can assist with visual impairments.
    Please kindly let us know by sending email to futurecareers.recruitment@unilever.com when you receive an invitation to Video Interview and register in SOVA platform so we can action. 
    Please note, if you do not reach out to us we will not be able to grant you extra time before you complete the assessment. 
    Video Interview: 
    We can provide extra time if needed. Additionally, accessibility options such as a magnifying glass, adjustable font sizes, color changes, screen rulers, and screen masks are available on the platform. 
    Discovery Centre (if successful): 
    reasonable adjustments to be discussed after being invited to the assessment day
    If there’s anything else we can do to support you or if the adjustments mentioned above don’t fully meet your needs, please let us know. 
    We are committed to ensuring you feel comfortable throughout the application process. Please acknowledge receiving this email.  
  
  These arte the adjustments I currently have in place that I want to communicate:   
    
    General recommendations for placements
    It is important that Placement Organisers and Providers: 
    Remain Flexible. It may not always be possible to identify in advance every adjustment that needs to be made. 
    In many cases it will be necessary to adapt support arrangements as the placement progresses, as the student progresses through the course and becomes more confident, or as new needs arise.
    Encourage an orientation visit to Placement Provider. 
    The student should be encouraged to organise a visit to the Placement Provider and advised to consider whether there are any specific disability-related issues that they can anticipate. 
    With support they should be encouraged to discuss any additional strategies, support and / or adjustments would be appropriate to address these.Discuss adjustments at progress meetings and periodic assessment.
    This will ensure that disability-related issues are taken into consideration throughout each placement and where necessary and appropriate, adjustments can be developed and modified as the student progresses.
    Ensure that all relevant staff are aware of any disability issues and adjustments relevant to placements.
    With the student's consent all staff directly responsible for organising, managing, assessing on placement, ought to be informed of any relevant disability-related issues, especially recommendations for support or adjustments.Specific adjustments for Hasan Akhtar in practice
    Hasan will require:
    - Clear information on the requirements of the placement
    - An orientation meeting several weeks before the placement starts
    - A supportive mentor who understands the barriers Hasan faces
    - Additional time to process information
    - Additional time to produce work (where necessary) - this may be required more at the start of the placement until Hasan becomes used to the demands.
    - Additional Time: 00:15 (hours:mins) Extra Time Per Hour
    - The additional time stated is required across all examinations and time bounded assessments. This does not include requests for assignment deadline extensions.
    - The Examinations Office should be provided with exam questions which have been modified to ensure that they do not contain any ambiguous text and have clear and obvious meaning

How does that look? Any changes needed?  

## Me
Can you give me some ideas for a python app that I can code quickly using Github copilot to showcase it's ability?  

## Co-Pilot
Absolutely! How about a “Weather Forecast” app? Using APIs like OpenWeatherMap, you can pull in real-time weather data. It’s simple, but the usage of API calls, data parsing, and user input demonstrates great functionality.

Or, try a “To-Do List” app. It's a classic. You can incorporate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a nice little GUI using Tkinter or Flask.

And if you’re up for a fun one, why not a “Quiz” app? It fetches questions from an online API, presents them to the user, and keeps track of scores.

Whichever you choose, GitHub Copilot can help streamline the coding process and auto-suggest lines of code. Which one do you fancy?  

## Me
Can you update the html so it links to this python code:  

    @app.route('/add', methods=['POST'])
    def add_task(): 
      task = request.form.get('task') 
      if task: 
        tasks.append(task) 
      return redirect(url_for('index'))
      
    @app.route('/delete/<int:task_id>')
    def delete_task(task_id): 
      if 0 <= task_id < len(tasks): 
        tasks.pop(task_id) 
      return redirect(url_for('index'))
      
    #method to update an existing task
    @app.route('/update/<int:task_id>', methods=['POST'])
    def update_task(task_id): 
      if 0 <= task_id < len(tasks): 
        tasks[task_id] = request.form.get('task') 
      return redirect(url_for('index'))
      
    #method to clear all tasks
    @app.route('/clear')
    def clear_tasks():
      tasks.clear() 
      return redirect(url_for('index'))
      
    #method to sort tasks in ascending order
    @app.route('/sort/ascending')
    def sort_ascending(): 
      tasks.sort() 
      return redirect(url_for('index'))
      
    #method to sort tasks in descending order
    @app.route('/sort/descending')
    def sort_descending(): 
      tasks.sort(reverse=True) 
      return redirect(url_for('index'))  

## Copilot
Sure thing! Here’s how you can link your Python code with the corresponding HTML.

Update your HTML to include forms and buttons for each route:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Task Manager</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Task Manager</h1>
    <form action="/add" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="task" placeholder="New Task">
        <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
    </form>

    <ul>
        {% for task in tasks %}
        <li>
            {{ task }}
            <form action="/delete/{{ loop.index0 }}" method="post" style="display:inline;">
                <button type="submit">Delete</button>
            </form>
            <form action="/update/{{ loop.index0 }}" method="post" style="display:inline;">
                <input type="text" name="task" placeholder="Update Task">
                <button type="submit">Update</button>
            </form>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <form action="/clear" method="post">
        <button type="submit">Clear All Tasks</button>
    </form>

    <form action="/sort/ascending" method="post">
        <button type="submit">Sort Ascending</button>
    </form>

    <form action="/sort/descending" method="post">
        <button type="submit">Sort Descending</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure you’re using the appropriate HTTP methods in your routes, and ensure the forms in your HTML match those methods and URLs. This setup should have you covered. How does that look?  

## Me
I still want to include the styles and div like this: 

    <div class="container"> 
      <h1>To-Do List</h1> 
      <input type="text" id="new-task" placeholder="Add a new task..." /> 
      <button onclick="addTask()">Add</button> 
      <ul id="tasks"> 
        <!-- Tasks will be dynamically added here --> 
      </ul> 
    </div>  

## Copilot
Got it. Let’s mesh your HTML styles and the `div` structure with the necessary form actions. Here’s how you can do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>To-Do List</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            width: 300px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            text-align: center;
        }
        input[type="text"] {
            width: 80%;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px 0;
        }
        button {
            padding: 10px 20px;
            margin: 5px;
        }
        ul {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 0;
        }
        li {
            margin: 10px 0;
            padding: 10px;
            background-color: #f9f9f9;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>To-Do List</h1>
        <form action="/add" method="post">
            <input type="text" id="new-task" name="task" placeholder="Add a new task..." />
            <button type="submit">Add</button>
        </form>
        <ul id="tasks">
            {% for task in tasks %}
            <li>
                {{ task }}
                <form action="/delete/{{ loop.index0 }}" method="post" style="display:inline;">
                    <button type="submit">Delete</button>
                </form>
                <form action="/update/{{ loop.index0 }}" method="post" style="display:inline;">
                    <input type="text" name="task" placeholder="Update Task">
                    <button type="submit">Update</button>
                </form>
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        <form action="/clear" method="post">
            <button type="submit">Clear All Tasks</button>
        </form>
        <form action="/sort/ascending" method="post">
            <button type="submit">Sort Ascending</button>
        </form>
        <form action="/sort/descending" method="post">
            <button type="submit">Sort Descending</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This combines the styling and structure you wanted with the functionality of the routes you mentioned. Looks neat, huh?  

## Me
How can I make it so each of the buttons are on the same line and then there are 2 tasks per line?  

## Copilot
To get all the buttons on the same line, and have two tasks per line, we can use a bit of CSS magic. Here’s the updated HTML and CSS to achieve that:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>To-Do List</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            width: 500px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            text-align: center;
        }
        input[type="text"] {
            width: 60%;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px 0;
        }
        button {
            padding: 10px 15px;
            margin: 5px;
        }
        ul {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 0;
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
            justify-content: space-between;
        }
        li {
            margin: 10px 0;
            padding: 10px;
            background-color: #f9f9f9;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            width: 48%;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            align-items: center;
        }
        .task-actions {
            display: flex;
            gap: 5px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>To-Do List</h1>
        <form action="/add" method="post">
            <input type="text" id="new-task" name="task" placeholder="Add a new task..." />
            <button type="submit">Add</button>
        </form>
        <ul id="tasks">
            {% for task in tasks %}
            <li>
                {{ task }}
                <div class="task-actions">
                    <form action="/delete/{{ loop.index0 }}" method="post" style="display:inline;">
                        <button type="submit">Delete</button>
                    </form>
                    <form action="/update/{{ loop.index0 }}" method="post" style="display:inline;">
                        <input type="text" name="task" placeholder="Update Task">
                        <button type="submit">Update</button>
                    </form>
                </div>
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        <form action="/clear" method="post">
            <button type="submit">Clear All Tasks</button>
        </form>
        <form action="/sort/ascending" method="post">
            <button type="submit">Sort Ascending</button>
        </form>
        <form action="/sort/descending" method="post">
            <button type="submit">Sort Descending</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, the buttons are on the same line and the tasks are displayed two per line. Looks pretty sleek, right?  

## Me
No I want the Add, Clear all and Sort buttons on the same line and the buttons inside the individula tasks should remain unaffected?  

## Copilot
Got it. Let's make those adjustments:

To place the “Add Task,” “Clear All Tasks,” and “Sort” buttons on the same line, update your HTML like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>To-Do List</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            width: 500px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            text-align: center;
        }
        input[type="text"] {
            width: 60%;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px 0;
        }
        button {
            padding: 10px 15px;
            margin: 5px;
        }
        ul {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 0;
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
            justify-content: space-between;
        }
        li {
            margin: 10px 0;
            padding: 10px;
            background-color: #f9f9f9;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            width: 48%;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            align-items: center;
        }
        .task-actions {
            display: flex;
            gap: 5px;

                        <input type="text" name="task" placeholder="Update Task">
                        <button type="submit">Update</button>
                    </form>
                </div>
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This should align the “Add Task,” “Clear All Tasks,” and “Sort” buttons on the same line while keeping the buttons inside individual tasks unaffected. What do you think?

(Now Wednesday, Oct 23)  
Can you design a small webpage that has a large heading (h1), a label saying "File upload" with a button to upload a Word doc and then on the next line a label saying "Output file name" with an input box that allows the user to enter a file name on that line?  

## Copilot
Here you go! This simple webpage has a large heading, a file upload button, and an input box for the output file name:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>File Upload</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            width: 400px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 20px;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            border-radius: 8px;
            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        }
        h1 {
            font-size: 2em;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
        label {
            display: block;
            margin: 15px 0 5px;
            font-size: 1.2em;
        }
        input[type="file"],
        input[type="text"] {
            width: 100%;
            padding: 10px;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            border-radius: 4px;
        }
        button {
            padding: 10px 20px;
            background-color: #4CAF50;
            color: white;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 4px;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        button:hover {
            background-color: #45a049;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>File Upload</h1>
        <label for="file-upload">File Upload</label>
        <input type="file" id="file-upload" accept=".doc, .docx">
        <label for="output-file-name">Output File Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="output-file-name" placeholder="Enter output file name">
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Pop this into an HTML file and open it in your browser. Should work seamlessly!  

## Me
How can I write a method in Python using flask then that processes that file upload?  

## Copilot
To handle file uploads with Flask, you can create a route that accepts the uploaded file, processes it, and returns an appropriate response. Here’s a basic example of how you might do this:

1. First, ensure you have Flask installed:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

2. Here’s a Flask app that includes the file upload route:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, render_template
    import os

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads'
    os.makedirs(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], exist_ok=True)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return render_template('index.html')

    @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
    def upload_file():
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            return 'No file part'
        file = request.files['file']
        if file.filename == '':
            return 'No selected file'
        if file:
            filename = file.filename
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
            return 'File successfully uploaded'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

3. Update your HTML form to target this new route:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>File Upload</title>
        <style>
            .container {
                width: 400px;
                margin: 0 auto;
                text-align: center;
                padding: 20px;
                border: 1px solid #ddd;
                border-radius: 8px;
                box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
            }
            h1 {
                font-size: 2em;
                margin-bottom: 20px;
            }
            label {
                display: block;
                margin: 15px 0 5px;
                font-size: 1.2em;
            }
            input[type="file"],
            input[type="text"] {
                width: 100%;
                padding: 10px;
                margin-bottom: 20px;
                border: 1px solid #ccc;
                border-radius: 4px;
            }
            button {
                padding: 10px 20px;
                background-color: #4CAF50;
                color: white;
                border: none;
                border-radius: 4px;
                cursor: pointer;
            }
            button:hover {
                background-color: #45a049;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>File Upload</h1>
            <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
                <label for="file-upload">File Upload</label>
                <input type="file" id="file-upload" name="file" accept=".doc, .docx">
                <label for="output-file-name">Output File Name</label>
                <input type="text" id="output-file-name" name="output-filename" placeholder="Enter output file name">
                <button type="submit">Upload</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

Run the Flask app and open your HTML file in a browser to test it. This setup will handle the file upload and save the file in an `uploads` directory. How does this look for you?

## Me
Based on my Cover letter, how could I answer this competency question (give me ideas, not a draft or the full thing, please):  
Cover letter:  

    I am writing to express my interest in the Industrial Placement opportunity at Unilever, as advertised. 
    As a second-year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Bradford, I achieved an extraordinary 88% average in my First Year. 
    I am now eager to apply my technical skills and passion for innovation to contribute to Unilever’s mission of making sustainable living commonplace.

    During my recent internship at the Bradford Children and Families Trust, I developed and deployed an AI-powered document 
    search tool, authored a business report on AI mitigation strategies, and built a work hours calculator using Python and Microsoft Power Apps. 
    These experiences have honed my technical communication, problem-solving, and project management skills, as well as my independent research skills which I believe all align well with the requirements of the R&D roles at Unilever.
    
    My volunteer work at The Children’s Society and my experience at Boots Pharmacy have further developed my organisational and communication skills. 
    These roles required resilience, teamwork, and the ability to handle diverse tasks efficiently, all of which are essential for thriving in a dynamic and collaborative environment like Unilever.
    
    I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work in areas such as Technical Project Lead, Consumer Technical Insights, and Science & Technology. 
    My academic background in computer science, combined with my hands-on experience in AI and software development, positions me well to contribute to Unilever’s innovative projects and sustainability goals.
    
    Unilever’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and employee well-being resonates with my values. 
    I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working in a supportive environment where I can grow professionally and make a meaningful impact.
    
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and aspirations align with the goals of Unilever.

It looks like you're encountering an error with MySQL in XAMPP, specifically related to Aria recovery failing. This can happen due to corrupted files or incomplete recovery processes. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Run XAMPP as Administrator**: Sometimes, running XAMPP with administrative privileges can resolve permission-related issues.
2. **Restore Database Backup**: If you have a backup of your database, try restoring it.
3. **Change MySQL Port**: Changing the MySQL port in the XAMPP configuration might help if there's a port conflict.
4. **Check Aria Tables**: Run `aria_chk -r` on all Aria tables and delete all `aria_log` files as suggested by the error message.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you might want to check out detailed tutorials or forums for more specific guidance. Does this help, or do you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps?

It looks like you're encountering an error with MySQL in XAMPP, specifically related to Aria recovery failing. This can happen due to corrupted files or incomplete recovery processes. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Run XAMPP as Administrator**: Sometimes, running XAMPP with administrative privileges can resolve permission-related issues.
2. **Restore Database Backup**: If you have a backup of your database, try restoring it.
3. **Change MySQL Port**: Changing the MySQL port in the XAMPP configuration might help if there's a port conflict.
4. **Check Aria Tables**: Run `aria_chk -r` on all Aria tables and delete all `aria_log` files as suggested by the error message.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you might want to check out detailed tutorials or forums for more specific guidance. Does this help, or do you need more detailed instructions on any of these steps?
