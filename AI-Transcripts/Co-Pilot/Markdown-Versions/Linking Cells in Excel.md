Certainly! You can link cells in Excel using various methods. Let's explore a few options:

1. **Linking Cells within the Same Worksheet:**
   - To link cell `I6` to cell `M6`, type `=` in cell `I6`, then click on cell `M6` and press Enter.
   - Repeat the same process for cells `N6` and `O6`.

2. **Linking Cells Between Worksheets in the Same Workbook:**
   - Copy the value from cell `I6`.
   - Go to the target worksheet (e.g., "Sheet2") and right-click on cell `M6`.
   - Choose "Paste Link" from the context menu.

3. **Linking Cells Between Different Workbooks:**
   - In the target workbook, enter `=` in cell `M6`.
   - Switch to the source workbook, click on cell `I6`, and press Enter.
   - Repeat this process for cells `N6` and `O6`.

Remember that linked cells will automatically update when the source data changes. Feel free to explore these methods based on your specific needs! ðŸ˜Š

Certainly! Let's create hyperlinks from one sheet to multiple cells in another sheet. You have a couple of options:

1. **Using the HYPERLINK Function:**
   - Open the sheet where you want to insert the hyperlinks (let's call it "Sheet2").
   - In a cell (e.g., `C5`), enter the following formula:
     ```
     =HYPERLINK("#Sheet1!C6", "Marks")
     ```
     Replace `Sheet1` with the name of your source sheet and adjust the cell reference (`C6`) as needed.
   - Drag the fill handle down to copy the formula to cells `C7`, `C8`, and `C9`.

2. **Using the Context Menu:**
   - Right-click on the cell where you want to add the hyperlink in "Sheet2."
   - Select "Link" from the options.
   - Choose "Place in this Document."
   - Enter the name you want to display (e.g., "Marks") and specify the cell reference (`C6`) in "Sheet1."
   - Click OK.

Remember to adjust the sheet names and cell references according to your specific workbook. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
