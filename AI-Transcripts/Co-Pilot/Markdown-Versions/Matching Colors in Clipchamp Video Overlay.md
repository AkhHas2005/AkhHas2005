To ensure that the colors of your image overlay match the video background in Clipchamp, you can use the **Adjust Colors** section. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Select the Image Overlay**: Click on the image overlay in your timeline to highlight it.
2. **Open Adjust Colors**: On the right side of the screen, find and click on the **Adjust Colors** tab.
3. **Use the Sliders**:
   - **Brightness**: Adjust to match the lightness or darkness of the video.
   - **Contrast**: Modify to ensure the image doesn't stand out too starkly.
   - **Saturation**: Increase or decrease to match the color intensity.
   - **Hue**: Shift the overall color tone to align with the video.
   - **Temperature**: Adjust to make the image warmer (more yellow) or cooler (more blue) to match the video's color temperature.

4. **Preview and Fine-Tune**: Continuously preview your adjustments and fine-tune the settings until the image blends seamlessly with the video[^1^][9].

This process might require some trial and error, but with these tools, you should be able to achieve a consistent look. If you need more detailed guidance, you can check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCc6kEKSmvA) on adjusting colors in Clipchamp[^2^][7].

To match the colors of your image overlay with the video background in Clipchamp, you can start with these settings and then fine-tune as needed:

1. **Brightness**: Adjust to match the lightness or darkness of the video. Start with a slight increase or decrease (e.g., ±10).
2. **Contrast**: Modify to ensure the image doesn't stand out too starkly. A small adjustment (e.g., ±5) can help.
3. **Saturation**: Increase or decrease to match the color intensity. Try a moderate adjustment (e.g., ±15).
4. **Hue**: Shift the overall color tone to align with the video. Small changes (e.g., ±5) can make a big difference.
5. **Temperature**: Adjust to make the image warmer (more yellow) or cooler (more blue) to match the video's color temperature. Start with a slight adjustment (e.g., ±10).

Given the colors visible in your image, you might want to:

- **Brightness**: Increase slightly if the image appears darker than the video.
- **Contrast**: Decrease slightly if the image has more defined edges than the video.
- **Saturation**: Increase if the image colors are duller than the video.
- **Hue**: Adjust to match any dominant color tones in the video.
- **Temperature**: Warm up the image if the video has a warmer tone, or cool it down if the video has a cooler tone.

These settings are a starting point. You may need to tweak them further to achieve a perfect match. If you need more detailed guidance, you can check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCc6kEKSmvA) on adjusting colors in Clipchamp[^1^][2].
