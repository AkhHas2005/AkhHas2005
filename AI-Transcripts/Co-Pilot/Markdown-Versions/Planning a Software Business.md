# Planning a Software Business  

## Me
Me and my friends are planning on opeing a Sofwtare business together in about 2-3 years time. Based on the following notes of what we've previously discussed, what could we discuss in this week's meeting:  
Company Roles/Structure  
- Starting out = Group of 5 or 10 of us
- To begin: Each of business areas
- As we go along = More of us, start hiring workers
- Roles are deterministic on u could do it rather than strength-based skill set
- This is so we can cover all different business areas and have functioning business model
- Adam Shabbir = Marketing, Hasan Akhtar = Overseer/Lead Developer, Rayhaan Hussain = Finance
- To begin with, we all develop products together with Hasan as a leader.
Survey Monkey/GitHub Development
- Researching and trying to setup functional tools for pre-business functions within the meeting
- GOOGLE COLAB IS GETTING BOYCOTTED
- Adam looked into real-time collaboration on coding projects, started setting up GitHub Codespaces
- Hasan looked into SurveyMonkey and made an account, shared details of different plans
- Hasan & Adam then tested out the Live Share feature within the GitHub Codespaces and it worked surprisingly well
- Rayhaan attended unexpectedly and very late, just offered moral support then
Research & Marketing
- Ask people on street, make surveys
- Interview random people based on business ideas
- Have clear objective
- Still go for specific audience
- Survey monkey, easy to find people
- Just try your best
- Sales, customer needs, trending products
- Contacting companies
- Assess current market, develop unique selling points
Proposed Implementations
- Finance sector could be targeted
- Probably don't do in person surveys, mostly online surveys, start in 2026/2027
- Target audiences on YouTube, SurveyMonkey, etc.
- Testing different logos, brand ideas and names
- Finding specific areas of lives that people struggle the most with in terms of software
- Maybe contact companies with solid foundations
- Start small with companies, build up portfolio
- Focus on AI enhancements as well
Products
- Should have at least 3 different products (software solutions) at all times
- 1 should be gaming related (Rayhaan to concentrate on that) and 2 non-gaming (me & Adam to concentrate on those)
- 2 should be AI powered (due to increasing prevalence of AI within software development) and 1 should be kept as non-AI (as to keep an easier to develop non-AI solution as well)
Proposed Solution
- An AI Gaming assistant
- Would be able to traverse offline games (especially story modes) while player is away or can't be asked playing
- Would need to be highly intelligent to handle some games and is ambitious to say the least
- Would be more general purpose, try to cover as many bases as possible
- Would only be used for offline game modes or elements of games, against policies and unfair if used for online features or online game modes
- Would train it for a specific game first then move on to incorporate more games, good starting point would be Minecraft story mode as suggested by Adam

## Me
(Now Thursday, Dec 26)  
Based on these notes form last week, what can we discuss today:  
Company Roles/Structure  
- Strength based = we each work based on our strengths, but there would be areas that aren't. We'd need specialists for each area, but it would lead to too much money costs.
- Deterministic = Each person does a different role and adapt themselves to said role.
- Would take time for each of us to learn new skills
- In terms of leadership, I (Hasan Akhtar) will be CEO, mostly in charge of software. Rayhaan Hussain & Adam Shabbir will maintain their status as co-founders and mostly concentrate on their business areas
- It will be like a triangular structure where we're all on a similar level
Research & Marketing
- In terms of hiring, we can start by hiring in marketing and research, need quite a few people for this, need to market it properly
- Market research is not useful right now because by the time we set it up, market research would be outdated
- Someone Hasan knows said "You need a lot of marketing and research to be able to get your product out there and advertised"
Proposed Implementations
- Decide on tools and technologies closer to time based on what we already have and what would need outsourcing then
- Rayhaan - Finance Sector Targeting, Marketing Channels â€“ Hasan and Adam, Brand Identity - Adam, Company Outreach â€“ Hasan
General Discussions
- Rayhaan actually arrived on time and should keep this up now ðŸ«¡
- "as the business grows" is way too vague and it could lead to money losses in the future
- Sun Tsu: Art of War â€“ Contains section great for business
- Next meeting (Programming Project progression) - 3pm on Saturday 21st

## Co-Pilot
You've got some solid ground to cover in today's meeting. Here's a list of specific discussion points based on your notes from last week:

### Company Roles/Structure
1. **Strength-Based vs. Deterministic Roles**: Weigh the pros and cons of each approach. Consider the potential cost of hiring specialists versus the learning curve for team members adapting to new roles.
2. **Skill Development Timeline**: Create a realistic timeline for skill development if adopting deterministic roles.
3. **Leadership Structure**: Finalize Hasan's role as CEO, with Rayhaan and Adam as co-founders. Define the responsibilities of each role clearly.
4. **Triangular Leadership Model**: Discuss how the triangular leadership model will function in practice and ensure everyone is comfortable with it.

### Research & Marketing
1. **Hiring Strategy for Marketing and Research**: Determine the number of hires needed and outline the hiring process.
2. **Market Research Timing**: Plan the right time to conduct market research to ensure it's relevant and up-to-date when needed.
3. **Marketing Importance**: Reinforce the importance of marketing and research to the team, possibly by sharing insights from Hasanâ€™s contact.

### Proposed Implementations
1. **Tool and Technology Decisions**: Decide on a process for selecting tools and technologies as you get closer to launch. Discuss current tools and any potential outsourcing needs.
2. **Responsibility Assignments**: Confirm the assignments:
   - **Finance Sector Targeting**: Rayhaan
   - **Marketing Channels**: Hasan and Adam
   - **Brand Identity**: Adam
   - **Company Outreach**: Hasan

### General Discussions

2. **Clarifying Growth Statements**: Define what "as the business grows" means in concrete terms to avoid vagueness that could lead to financial losses.
3. **Sun Tzu's Art of War**: Review the sections relevant to business strategy and discuss how they can be applied to your business.
