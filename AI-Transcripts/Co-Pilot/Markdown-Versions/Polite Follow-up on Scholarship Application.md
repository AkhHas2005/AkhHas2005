# Polite Follow-up on Scholarship Application  

## Me
Over 2 weeks ago, I sent this email to a professional engineer at the Royal Academy of Engineering, how can I follow-up in a polite and professional way:  

```
Good morning Lauren,

Below is the first draft of my application for the Engineering Leaders Scholarship Award,
I would like you to review it and suggest improvements that I could make to it.

Q1 - Tell us how you think engineering can be used in the future to address at least
one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and what role would you like to play in this?

A1 - In my chosen engineering sector (software engineering/computer science) I believe that I
can help ensure inclusive quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all,
especially in foreign countries, by creating new software technologies or improving existing solutions.
I also believe that I can contribute to projects where software can be used to help
research or implement better access to affordable and clean energy for all.
Furthermore, I have confidence that I can build software technologies that help enhance productivity
and economic growth within the workspace and as an engineering leader ensure this within the company where I work.

Q2 – Describe an engineering project which you are proud of, and where you showed leadership.
What was your contribution to the project, and what did you learn from it?

A2 - In a University project in Semester 2 of second year I was part of a group of 8 or 9 other students
where we were developing an extra-curricular activities system for university societies in Java.
At the start, I took the initiative to research roles that each team member could perform during the project
and share them with the group. When we did the first meeting to assign roles, I was voted (by other group members) to be the leader.
During the project, I assigned tasks to the group members and did a lot of work myself,
I maintained communication with the group members and chased up them up if they weren't present,
I offered support as well and sympathised with their circumstances.
In the end, we produced an outstanding project with web pages linked to the Java backend and the team members were
thoroughly impressed with my leadership, support and general contribution, we achieved 92% in this project as a team.
I also learnt a lot from the experience and developed my skills in collaborative work,
supporting team members and managing a group of individuals. I learnt what it means to achieve success as a team and
how to manage everything including meetings with the team and the 'client' (our tutor).

Q3 - How would you put the scholarship funding to use and how will you use it to
advance your opportunity to become a leader in engineering? Please be as specific as you can.

A3 - In terms of the funding, there are certain areas that I would like to improve upon and
that I believe would advance my opportunity in becoming a leader in engineering. One of those areas would be my People skills,
I would like to attend events/workshops that work on building these skills and developing these to improve my
internal team collaboration but also my collaboration with other teams and external partners. Networking events would also be great for this I believe.
I would also like to develop Business management skills as I plan on creating my own software/IT consultancy start-up
that can help mitigate some of the challenges I discussed in Q1. Another are I would like to focus on is Public Speaking.
I would like to attend events and educate students, possibly as a guest lecturer on key software engineering/computer science topics such as OOP,
Code Maintenance, Design Principles, Agile Methodologies, Software Architecture and more.
I would also like to build, develop and adapt software solutions to not just meet business/industry challenges but also help mitigate
social and environmental challenges within a workplace environment.

Also attached is my Reference Letter and My Letter of confirmation from University, let me know if they're ok or if they need amending.

Many Thanks,
Hasan Akhtar

**Subject:** Follow-up on Engineering Leaders Scholarship Application

Good afternoon Lauren,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on my previous email sent over two weeks ago regarding my application for the Engineering Leaders Scholarship Award. I wanted to inquire if you had the opportunity to review my draft and if there are any suggestions or improvements you could kindly provide.

Your expertise and feedback would be invaluable to me, and I am eager to refine my application to the best of my ability. If you need more time, please let me know, and I am happy to wait. Alternatively, if you could suggest a convenient time for us to discuss any feedback, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

How can I follow-up on this email to work colleagues:

Hi all,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am pleased to share that I have made somewhat significant progress on the AI document extraction program.
I anticipate that the demo will be ready within the next one to two months, after which we can move forward from there, hopefully.

I will provide another update on my progress in approximately one month.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
Hasan Akhtar
```

In the follow-up email, I want to include the following points:  
- as previously iterated, the demo should go ahead this month
- everything is almost ready on my side
- what would be a good date and time to do the meeting in the next few days, bear in mind I only work Mondays and Wednesday afternoons at the moment
