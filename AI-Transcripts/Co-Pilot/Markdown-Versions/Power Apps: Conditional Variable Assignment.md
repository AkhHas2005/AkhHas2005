# Power Apps: Conditional Variable Assignment  

## Me
how can I write an if statement for a formula in power apps: I want the formula to set a variable called hours to Textbox2.value if the selected item in ComboBox1 is per day and if it's per week divide this value by 5?

Certainly! In Power Apps, you can use the `If` function to create conditional statements. Let's break down your requirement:

1. If the selected item in `ComboBox1` is "per day," set the `hours` variable to `Textbox2.Value`.
2. If the selected item in `ComboBox1` is "per week," divide `Textbox2.Value` by 5.

Here's how you can write this in Power Apps:

```PowerApps
Set(hours,
    If(ComboBox1.Selected.Value = "per day",
        Textbox2.Value,
        Textbox2.Value / 5
    )
)
```

Explanation:
- The `If` function checks the condition (whether the selected item is "per day").
- If true, it assigns `Textbox2.Value` to the `hours` variable.
- If false (i.e., "per week"), it divides `Textbox2.Value` by 5.

Feel free to adjust the field names and values according to your specific app setup! ðŸ˜Š

How can I declare/assign a new variable called hours?  

## Co-Pilot
Certainly! To declare and assign a new variable called `hours` in Power Apps, you can use the `Set` function. Here's how you can do it:

```PowerApps
Set(hours, 0)  // Initialize the variable with a default value (e.g., 0)
```

Replace `0` with the appropriate initial value if needed. Now you can use the `hours` variable in your app! ðŸ˜Š
