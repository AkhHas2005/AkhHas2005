Feel free to tweak this draft to better suit your needs and add the links to your survey forms. Good luck with your venture! 😊

(Now Sunday, Mar 9)  
Okay so I sent the previous LinkedIn message however the amount of form responses was scarse so how can I follow requesting more people to fill out the forms especially.  
Also how can I send an informal WhatsApp message to my friends and other contacts also regarding the forms?  

## Co-Pilot
To boost engagement with your forms, you can craft a follow-up LinkedIn post and a friendly WhatsApp message. Here's how you can approach both:
