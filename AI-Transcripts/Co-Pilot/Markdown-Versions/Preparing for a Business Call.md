# Preparing for a Business Call  

## Me
I have a former work colleague who revealed at work that she wants to start her own business in future. I also want to start my own business and so we agreed we could give tips and help each other out. We've arranged a short 10 minute call but what could we talk about?

That's great that you both have entrepreneurial aspirations! Here are some ideas for your 10-minute call:

1. **Current Status**: Briefly share where each of you is in your business journey. Are you in the planning phase, or have you already started?

2. **Business Ideas**: Exchange your business ideas. Discuss what industries you're interested in and why.

3. **Challenges**: Talk about any challenges you're facing. This could be anything from finding funding to marketing strategies.

4. **Resources**: Share any useful resources you've found, such as books, podcasts, or online courses.

5. **Networking**: Discuss any networking events or groups that might be beneficial for both of you.

6. **Next Steps**: Outline your next steps and see if there are ways you can support each other in the coming weeks.

7. **Future Meetings**: Plan for future check-ins to keep each other motivated and accountable.

This should give you a solid structure for your call and ensure you make the most of your time together. Good luck with your business ventures! ðŸš€

## Me
we're both planning on starting in the intermediate future, so about 3 years or so, what would you say then regarding this additional piece of information as well  

## Co-Pilot
Given that you both plan to start your businesses in about three years, you can tailor your conversation to focus on long-term planning and preparation. Here are some additional points to discuss:

1. **Long-Term Goals**: Share your long-term business goals and visions. Where do you see your businesses in five to ten years?

2. **Skill Development**: Identify any skills you need to develop over the next few years. This could include leadership, financial management, or industry-specific skills.

3. **Market Research**: Discuss how you plan to conduct market research to understand your target audience and competitors better.

4. **Financial Planning**: Talk about saving strategies and how you plan to secure funding when the time comes. This could include personal savings, loans, or investors.

5. **Networking**: Plan to attend industry events, join professional groups, or take part in online communities to build your network over time.

6. **Mentorship**: Consider finding mentors who can provide guidance and support as you prepare to launch your businesses.

7. **Timeline and Milestones**: Set a timeline with key milestones to track your progress over the next three years. This can help keep you both accountable and motivated.

8. **Learning Resources**: Share any courses, books, or workshops that could be beneficial for your business preparation.

By focusing on these areas, you can make the most of your call and set a strong foundation for your future businesses. ðŸŒŸ

Is there a specific industry you're both interested in, or are your business ideas quite different?
