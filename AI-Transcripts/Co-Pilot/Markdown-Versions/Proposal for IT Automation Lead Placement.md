# Proposal for IT Automation Lead Placement  

## Me
I'm currently working for a public sector company that liases with teh local council. I'm working part time at the moment while going to university following on from a 10 week summer internship that i did with thr organisation. Next year is my placement year and my manager has welcomed that I talk about what I want to do with him so he can prepare and assess the feasibility of my placement requests. How can I best convey the following regarding my placement:  
- I would like to do a placement here but take my role as IT Automation officer to the next level and become an IT Automation Lead
- I would like to lead my own team in IT Automations, producing Power Automate solutions and also some AI Powered Solutions in Python
- This would probably involve me hiring 2 or 3 others for my team and you could help with the interview process
- Through this, I would be able to manage the apps and software that I've already created, deploy/further implement some solutions and also tackle new challenges/explore new solutions
- I've also applied for an Engineering Leaders Scholarship and would like to continue developing my leadership skills through this as well

**Subject: Placement Year Proposal - IT Automation Lead Role**

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. As we discussed, I'm excited to explore the possibilities for my upcoming placement year with our organization. I would like to take this opportunity to outline my aspirations and proposed contributions for your consideration.

**1. Advancing My Role:**
I am keen to continue my journey here by taking my current role as IT Automation Officer to the next level and transitioning into an IT Automation Lead role. I believe this would enable me to leverage my existing skills and experiences to contribute more significantly to our projects.

**2. Leading an IT Automation Team:**
In this new role, I envision leading a dedicated team focused on developing Power Automate solutions and AI-powered solutions using Python. To achieve this, I propose the formation of a small team comprising 2-3 additional members. I would be grateful for your support in the interview and hiring process for these positions.

**3. Project Management and Innovation:**
With a dedicated team, I would be able to manage and enhance the applications and software I have already created. Additionally, I would have the capacity to deploy further implementations and tackle new challenges by exploring innovative solutions that align with our organization's goals.

**4. Leadership Development:**
I am also excited to share that I have applied for the Engineering Leaders Scholarship. This opportunity would allow me to continue developing my leadership skills, which I believe would be beneficial for both my role and our team's overall success.

I am eager to discuss the feasibility of this proposal and any additional steps we can take to make this a reality. Thank you for considering my request and for your continued support.

Best regards,

By framing your request this way, you'll convey your ambitions clearly and demonstrate your proactive approach to both personal and professional development. What do you think?  

## Me
What salary would you suggest I negotiate for this role, a normal placement role is in teh region of 20-30k for the year, however this role would have much more responsibility and is a small scale management role  

## Co-Pilot
Given the increased responsibilities and management aspects of the role, it's reasonable to negotiate a higher salary than the typical placement range. Based on the average salaries for IT Automation Lead roles in the UK, which range from **£47,575 to £72,500 per year**, you could aim for a salary closer to the higher end of this range, around **£65,000 to £70,000 per year**.

This range takes into account the additional responsibilities and leadership aspects of the role. It's always a good idea to research industry standards and be prepared to justify your request with examples of your skills, experiences, and the value you'll bring to the team.

Does this range sound reasonable to you?  

## Me
(Now Friday, Feb 28)  
Yes,since it's a placement year, I think a salary within the range of 45,000 to 55,000 would be feasible, how should I convey this to my manager  

## Co-Pilot
Here's a professional and tactful way to convey your salary expectations to your manager:

**Subject: Placement Year Proposal - Salary Discussion**

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well. Following our earlier conversations regarding my placement year and proposed role as IT Automation Lead, I wanted to discuss my salary expectations as part of the overall planning.

Given the scope of responsibilities I’m proposing—including team leadership, hiring, project management, and delivering innovative solutions—I believe a salary within the range of **£45,000 to £55,000** would be reasonable. This figure reflects the increased responsibilities and aligns with the current market rates for similar roles, while also taking into consideration the nature of this placement.

I am, of course, open to discussing this further and would be happy to adjust based on organizational priorities and any additional input you may have.

Thank you for your time and support—I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,

This approach is clear and professional, while leaving room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you've done your research and are considering the organizational context. What do you think?
