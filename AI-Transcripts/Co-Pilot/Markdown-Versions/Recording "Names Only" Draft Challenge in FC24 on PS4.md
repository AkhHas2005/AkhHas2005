If the in-game settings don't allow you to hide everything except player names during the draft screen, you can try a physical workaround. Here are a few methods you can use:

### 1. **Using Physical Covers:**
1. **Cut pieces of paper or cardboard** to cover the parts of the screen you want to hide.
2. **Attach them to your TV screen** using non-damaging tape. Make sure they only cover the areas you want to hide, leaving the player names visible.

### 2. **Adjusting TV Settings:**
1. **Check your TV settings** for any options to adjust the screen display.
2. Some TVs have a **zoom or crop feature** that might help you hide parts of the screen. This can be found in the **Picture Settings** menu.

### 3. **Using a Camera or Phone:**
1. **Record the screen** using a camera or phone.
2. **Position the camera** so that it only captures the part of the screen with the player names.

### 4. **Post-Editing:**
1. **Record the draft** as usual.
2. **Use video editing software** to blur or crop out the unwanted parts of the screen. This can be done using tools like **iMovie**, **Adobe Premiere**, or **DaVinci Resolve**.

### Tips:
- **Practice** setting up your physical covers or camera to ensure you get the best results.
- **Check online tutorials** for specific steps on using your TV's zoom or crop features.

yh but how can I make sure that when recording I can't see the other details to make sure I'm not cheating?  

## Co-Pilot
To ensure you can't see any other details while recording your draft and avoid any temptation to cheat, you can use a combination of in-game settings and video editing techniques. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Recording the Draft:**
1. **Start your game** and go to the draft screen.
2. **Press the Share button** on your PS4 controller.
3. Select **Start New Recording** to begin capturing your draft process.
4. Once you’ve completed your draft, press the **Share button** again and select **Stop Recording**.

### 2. **Editing the Video to Hide Details:**
1. **Transfer the video** to a computer using a USB drive.
2. Open a video editing software like **iMovie**, **Adobe Premiere**, or **DaVinci Resolve**.
3. **Import your video** into the software.

### 3. **Using Cropping and Blurring:**
1. **Crop the Video:**
   - Use the crop tool to focus only on the player names. This will cut out the rest of the screen, ensuring only the names are visible.
2. **Blur Unwanted Details:**
   - If cropping isn't enough, use the blur tool to obscure any remaining details that you don't want to be visible.

### 4. **Adding Overlays (Optional):**
1. **Create Overlays:**
   - You can create simple overlays (e.g., black boxes) in the video editor to cover specific parts of the screen.
2. **Position Overlays:**
   - Place these overlays over the areas you want to hide, ensuring only the player names are visible.

### 5. **Export and Review:**
1. **Export the Video:**
   - Once you’re satisfied with the edits, export the video in your desired format.
2. **Review the Video:**
   - Watch the video to ensure that only the player names are visible and all other details are hidden.

### Tips:
- **Practice** using the video editing software to get comfortable with the tools.
- **Look for tutorials** on YouTube for specific editing techniques if needed.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your draft recording only shows the player names, maintaining the integrity of your challenge. Would you like more detailed steps on any part of this process?  

## Me
yh but I'm still seeing the other details when recording and editing, how can I prevent myself from seeing these details?  

## Copilot
To ensure you don't see any other details while recording and editing your draft, you can use a few creative methods to physically block your view of the screen. Here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Using a Physical Barrier:**
1. **Create a Masking Template:**
   - Cut a piece of cardboard or paper to cover the parts of the screen you don't want to see.
   - Attach this template to your TV screen using non-damaging tape, ensuring it only covers the areas you want to hide.

### 2. **Using a Second Person:**
1. **Have a Friend Help:**
   - Ask a friend or family member to sit with you during the draft.
   - They can help by covering the parts of the screen you don't want to see with a piece of paper or their hand.

### 3. **Using a Camera or Phone:**
1. **Record Indirectly:**
   - Set up a camera or phone to record the screen.
   - Position the camera so that it only captures the player names, and you can focus on the camera screen instead of the TV.

### 4. **Using a Screen Overlay:**
1. **Create a Digital Overlay:**
   - Use a transparent overlay on your TV screen (like a piece of clear plastic) and mark the areas you want to hide with a non-permanent marker.
   - This way, you can still see the player names but not the other details.

### Tips:
- **Practice** setting up your physical barriers or camera to ensure you get the best results.
- **Check online tutorials** for specific steps on using your TV's zoom or crop features if available.

By using these methods, you can ensure that you only see the player names during the draft, maintaining the integrity of your challenge. Would you like more detailed steps on any of these methods?
