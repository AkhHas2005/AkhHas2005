How can I write an email to my colleague replying to this email:  

Hi Hasan  
I hope youâ€™re good!  
Iâ€™ve been chatting with James and Peter about what could be potentially automated in the Trust and Peter suggested that I drop you a message to see if youâ€™ve been working on anything relating to automation or if your research earlier in the year highlighted any areas where AI would be used to automate processes?  
Happy to have a chat when youâ€™re next in ðŸ˜Š  
Best,  
Libby  

I want to include information from my notes:  
Currently working on AI Document extraction features:  
Info: In meeting with PSO Youth team, agreed a deadline of about 2 or 3 months to demonstrate then  
Details: Using Python; document handling libaries; AI libraries and more, find a way to efficiently transfer data from one form to another.  
Using machine learning and the Python docx library to train a model to transfer data between 2 word documents accurately.  
Also planning on doing it for excel to word and similar file configurations with various form types.  
Things that I could possibly look into in future:  
The Trust encounters several operational challenges that could potentially be mitigated through AI. These include the manual entry of forms in the EHM and LCS systems and the need for manual data input from phone calls and emails by the IFD and CA. The subsequent section will explore AI solutions to address these issues.  
Addressing these challenges involves careful planning and consideration. AI technologies can automate repetitive tasks, enhancing productivity and reducing labour costs. In systems like LCS and EHM, AI applications could streamline tasks such as form completion and data extraction from communications. Implementing AI could include features like speech-to-text for phone calls, document intelligence for email summaries, and automated risk assessments for child referrals. Each AI application would be tailored to a different role and would only include the tools necessary for a worker in that role to improve their own productivity and no more or less.  
1. **Automated Scheduling and Calendar Management**:
- Develop an AI-powered system that can manage the diaries and appointments of the Assistant Director and Strategic Director.
- The system should automatically schedule meetings, prioritize tasks, and handle rescheduling based on availability and urgency.
- Implement natural language processing (NLP) to understand meeting requests and preferences.
2. **Email and Correspondence Handling**:
- Create an AI-driven email management tool that can categorize, prioritize, and draft responses to common queries.
- Use machine learning to identify urgent emails and escalate them to the PA for immediate attention.
- Implement sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of incoming emails and respond accordingly.
3. **Document Management and Reporting**:
- Develop an AI system that can extract relevant information from documents, reports, and minutes of meetings.
- Use machine learning to summarize lengthy documents and generate concise executive summaries.
- Automate the preparation of reports for committees and other meetings.
4. **Virtual Assistant for Information Retrieval**:
- Create a chatbot or virtual assistant that can quickly retrieve information about policies, procedures, and local government functions.
- Use AI to answer common queries related to safeguarding, health and safety, and governance.

Hi Libby,

I hope youâ€™re well!

Thanks for reaching out. I'm currently working on AI document extraction features. In a recent meeting with the PSO Youth team, we agreed on a deadline of around 2-3 months to demonstrate these capabilities. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **Current Work**: Using Python along with various document handling libraries and AI libraries, we aim to efficiently transfer data from one form to another. We're training a model to accurately transfer data between two Word documents using machine learning and the Python `docx` library. Additionally, we're planning to apply this to Excel-to-Word data transfers and other similar configurations.

- **Future Prospects**: I've identified several operational challenges within the Trust that could benefit from AI, such as manual data entry in the EHM and LCS systems, and data input from phone calls and emails by the IFD and CA teams. Potential AI applications could include:
  1. Automated scheduling and calendar management for Assistant and Strategic Directors using NLP.
  2. AI-driven email and correspondence handling to prioritize, categorize, and draft responses.
  3. AI systems for document management and reporting, including summarizing lengthy documents and automating report preparations.
  4. Virtual assistant for information retrieval related to policies, procedures, and local government functions.

I would be happy to discuss these in more detail when you're available next. Letâ€™s catch up soon!

Best,
Hasan

How about a response to this indicating that I'm free on Monday afternoon from 2pm onwards:  

Hi Hasan  
Iâ€™m good thanks, I hope you are too ðŸ˜Š  
This is really helpful thank you. Its good to get an overview of the AI projects. Iâ€™m still quite new to AI and the different types etc so it would probs be good to have a catch up about it so I can understand the objectives/aims of the use of these AI projects.  
Does Monday work for you?  
Best,  
Libby

Hi Libby,

I'm doing well, thank you! ðŸ˜Š

I'm glad you found the overview helpful. I'd be happy to discuss the AI projects and objectives with you to give you a better understanding.

Monday works perfectly for me. I'm available from 2pm onwards. Looking forward to our catch-up!

Best,
Hasan

(Now Tuesday, Dec 17)  
Based on the fact that me and my colleague are creating a project via Power Automate for our organisation and these are very brief notes from a meeting with our manager to clarify the situation, can you please put these notes into an email (expanding on them) to my colleague?  

Involve Finance, via email or link to form, who made initial request, who in finance authorised and which sap champion authorised  

## Co-Pilot
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a draft of the email to your colleague:

Subject: Follow-Up on Power Automate Project: Involving Finance

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope you're well.

Following our recent meeting with [Manager's Name], I wanted to provide a summary and expansion of the key points discussed to ensure we're all on the same page regarding our Power Automate project for the organisation.

**Meeting Summary:**

1. **Initial Request:**
   - Finance made the initial request for this automation project. We need to determine who specifically within Finance initiated this request.
 
2. **Authorisation:**
   - Itâ€™s important to clarify who in Finance has authorised the project. This helps us identify the key stakeholders and ensure all necessary approvals are in place.

3. **SAP Champion Authorisation:**
   - We need to identify which SAP Champion has given the green light for this project. This person will be crucial in helping us align our automated workflows with existing SAP processes.

**Action Items:**

- **Involvement of Finance:**
  - We should reach out to Finance via email or a link to a form to gather the following information:
    - The individual who made the initial request for automation.
    - The person in Finance who authorised the project.
    - The SAP Champion who approved our plans.

Please let me know if Iâ€™ve missed anything or if there are additional details we need to address. I'm happy to discuss further and work on the next steps together.

Best,
Hasan

Feel free to adjust any details as needed!  

## Me
How can I adapt it to a Teams message that is more informal and more concise?  

## Co-Pilot
Sure thing! Hereâ€™s a more informal and concise version for Teams:

Hey [Colleague's Name],

Quick update from our chat with [Manager's Name]:

1. **Finance Request:** Need to find out who in Finance made the initial request and who approved it.
2. **SAP Champion:** Confirm which SAP Champion authorised the project.

Can you help reach out to Finance for these details? Maybe via email or a form link?

Thanks!

Hasan
