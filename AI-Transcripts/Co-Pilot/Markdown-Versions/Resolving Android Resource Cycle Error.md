# Resolving Android Resource Cycle Error  

## Me
I'm trying to build an android app in android studio bjut it keeps crashing while testing, here is my code:

      float[] supportHeight = new float[numOfGoals];
      int distanceBetweenGoals;
      
      @Override

            } else {
              supportX[i] -= goalVelocity;
            }
            
            batch.draw(goalSupport, supportX[i], 0, 200, supportHeight[i]);
            batch.draw(goal, supportX[i], supportHeight[i], 300, 300);
            
            //barriers[i] = new Rectangle(supportX[i], supportHeight[i], supportX[i], supportHeight[i]);
          }
          
          if (ballY >= (height-100)) {
            ballY = height - 100;
          }
          if (Gdx.input.isTouched()) {
            thisFootball = 1;
          } else {
            thisFootball = 0;
          }
          if (ballY > 0 || velocity < 0) {
            velocity++;ballY -= velocity;
          }
        } else {
          if (Gdx.input.justTouched()) {
            gameState = 1;
          }
        }
        
        batch.draw(footballs[thisFootball], centreX, ballY, 300, 200);
        batch.end();  

## Co-Pilot
Alright, let's dive in. I see a potential issue in your code that might be causing the crash.

It looks like you're not updating the `Rectangle` instances in your `barriers` array. You have a commented-out line that could be key:
```java
// barriers[i] = new Rectangle(supportX[i], supportHeight[i], supportX[i], supportHeight[i]);
```

Instead, it should be something like this:
```java
barriers[i].set(supportX[i], supportHeight[i], goal.getWidth(), goal.getHeight());
```

This way, you update the position and size of each barrier based on the current position of the goal supports. Uncomment this line and modify it as shown. Try running your code again after making this change.

Hope that helps! Let me know how it goes.  

## Me
That made no difference, it still keeps crashing, usually when it crashes it's because of an infinite loop or something similar  

## Co-Pilot
Infinite loops are like the digital equivalent of getting lost in a maze with no way out. Fun times, eh?

Alright, let's hunt this down. An infinite loop might be occurring due to some logic that keeps running endlessly. I see a potential problem in your render method. The loop could be tied to the `goalVelocity` and updating the `supportX` positions. If the logic never meets the condition to exit the loop, it crashes.

Check your `for` loop:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < numOfGoals; i++) {
    if (supportX[i] < -goal.getWidth()) {
        supportX[i] += numOfGoals * distanceBetweenGoals;
        supportHeight[i] = randomGenerator.nextInt(600);
    } else {
        supportX[i] -= goalVelocity;
    }
}
```

If this logic continually fails to reset the `supportX[i]` positions correctly, it might trap your game in an infinite loop. Add some logging to see if the condition is being met as you expect:
```java
Gdx.app.log("Loop Debug", "supportX[" + i + "]: " + supportX[i]);
```

This might give you insight into where the infinite loop is happening. Worth a shot!  

## Me
How do I find the logs then?  

## Co-Pilot
Good call! To see the logs, you need to set up your Android logging properly. Here's a quick way to do it:

1. **Add logging statement:**
   Place `Gdx.app.log("Loop Debug", "supportX[" + i + "]: " + supportX[i]);` within your render loop where you want to check your values.

2. **Run your app:**
   Launch your app as you normally would. The logs will start streaming.

3. **Check the logcat:**
   In Android Studio, go to the "Logcat" tab at the bottom of your screen. Make sure your connected device or emulator is selected from the dropdown menu.

4. **Filter your logs:**
   Use the search bar in Logcat to filter by the tag you used in your log statement ("Loop Debug"). This way, you can quickly see your debug information without all the noise from other logs.

By doing this, you’ll get a better sense of what's going on inside your render loop and hopefully spot the infinite loop or other issues causing your app to crash.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes!  

## Me
It's still not working, I have no idea what's wrong, there's nothing in the logs either  

## Co-Pilot
Sounds like we're missing something small but critical. Try adding `try-catch` blocks around the code that might be causing the crashes to catch any exceptions that are not currently being logged. Something like:
```java
try {
    // Your code here
} catch (Exception e) {
    Gdx.app.log("Error", e.getMessage());
}
```

Wrap sections like this around your `render()` method, `for` loops, and anywhere else where the crash could be occurring. This way, even if there’s a hidden bug, it should show up in your logs.
 
If you still don’t see anything, another option could be narrowing it down by commenting out larger sections to see which part is causing the crash, then re-adding smaller parts to hone in on the issue. This iterative approach can help pinpoint the culprit.
 
Keep me updated! Let’s crack this.

## Co-Pilot
The error indicates a `NullPointerException` when trying to invoke the `glCreateShader` method. This suggests the `GL20` interface object is not properly initialized when your app starts.

The problem lies in the `ShapeRenderer` initialization in your `create()` method. It seems like the `ShapeRenderer` is being created before the OpenGL context is fully set up. To fix this, delay the creation of the `ShapeRenderer` object until after the OpenGL context is initialized:

First, remove this line from your variable declarations:
```java
ShapeRenderer shapes = new ShapeRenderer();
```

Then, move it to your `create()` method after `Gdx.gl` is available:
```java
@Override
public void create () {
    batch = new SpriteBatch();
    background = new Texture("Background.jpg");
    footballs = new Texture[2];
    goalSupport = new Texture("GoalSupport.png");
    goal = new Texture("Goal.png");
    footballs[0] = new Texture("Football.png");
    footballs[1] = new Texture("Football2.png");
    ballY = (Gdx.graphics.getHeight()/2) - 100;
    randomGenerator = new Random();
    goalVelocity = 4;
    distanceBetweenGoals = Gdx.graphics.getWidth() / 3;
    barriers = new Rectangle[numOfGoals];
    for (int i = 0; i < numOfGoals; i++) {
        supportX[i] = (Gdx.graphics.getWidth()/2) - 100 + i * distanceBetweenGoals;
        supportHeight[i] = randomGenerator.nextInt(600);
        barriers[i] = new Rectangle();
    }
    shapes = new ShapeRenderer(); // Initialize ShapeRenderer here
}
```

By ensuring that `ShapeRenderer` is initialized after the OpenGL context, you should avoid the `NullPointerException`.

Give this a shot and let’s see if your app stays on its feet this time!

I have the android manifest file here but I want to change the logo, I currently hae an image called logo.png stored in my assests folder:  

```xml

      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
  </application>
</manifest>  
```  

## Copilot
Got it. You'll need to move the `logo.png` image to the `res/drawable` folder. Then, update your Android Manifest file to reference the new logo:

1. Move `logo.png` to `res/drawable` folder.
2. Update the `android:icon` attribute in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to:
```xml
android:icon="@drawable/logo"
```

Your manifest should look like this:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    <uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00020000" android:required="true" />
    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:fullBackupContent="true"
        android:icon="@drawable/logo" 
        android:isGame="true"
        android:appCategory="game"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
        tools:ignore="UnusedAttribute">
        <activity
            android:name="com.has_akh.flying_football.AndroidLauncher"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:screenOrientation="landscape"
            android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|navigation|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout"
            android:exported="true">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

This should set your app’s icon to your `logo.png` image. Check it out and see if it works!

(Now Sunday, Oct 27)  
THis is my layout structure where I've got different logo sizes for different purposes such as small icon, large icon, etc. [Uploaded Image Expired]  

## Copilot
Great, your structure is spot-on for supporting multiple screen densities. To update your app icon with the various logo sizes, ensure you’ve placed the `logo.png` images in their corresponding drawable folders like so:
- `res/drawable-mdpi/logo.png`
- `res/drawable-hdpi/logo.png`
- `res/drawable-xhdpi/logo.png`
- `res/drawable-xxhdpi/logo.png`
- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi/logo.png`

Then, reference the icon in your `AndroidManifest.xml` using:
```xml
android:icon="@drawable/logo"
```

This way, your app uses the appropriate logo size for different screen resolutions. Your app should now display the correct icon on different devices. Let’s see how it looks!  

## Me
It's showing teh old logo still, do I need to update my logo_foreground.xml:

Updating `logo_foreground.xml` might be necessary if your app is using adaptive icons introduced in Android 8.0 (API level 26). But, if you just want to update the app's icon, here’s what you need to do:

1. **Make sure `logo.png` is in the `res/mipmap` folder** instead of the `assets` folder. You should have:
    - `res/mipmap-mdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-hdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-xhdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-xxhdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/logo.png`

2. **Update your `AndroidManifest.xml`** to use the new logo:
```xml
android:icon="@mipmap/logo"
```

3. **Create adaptive icons** if necessary:
   - `res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml` for background and foreground.
   - `res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` and `ic_launcher_background.xml` to define vector paths.

For `ic_launcher.xml`, update to:
```xml
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <background android:drawable="@color/ic_launcher_background"/>
    <foreground android:drawable="@drawable/logo"/>
</adaptive-icon>
```

If your old icon still shows, **clean and rebuild your project** in Android Studio to ensure all changes are applied.

Try these steps out and your new logo should be good to go!  

## Me
I don't want to use ic_launcher I want to use logo  

## Copilot
Got it, you want to sidestep `ic_launcher` altogether. 

1. **First**, ensure your `logo.png` files are in the `res/mipmap` directories for various screen densities:
    - `res/mipmap-mdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-hdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-xhdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-xxhdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/logo.png`

2. **Next**, update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to use `logo` instead of `ic_launcher`:
```xml
<application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:fullBackupContent="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/logo" 
    android:isGame="true"
    android:appCategory="game"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
    tools:ignore="UnusedAttribute">
```

3. **Finally**, clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio to ensure all changes are picked up.

Try these steps and your new logo should be front and center!  

## Me
I want to keep my logo in drawable but use logo.png instead of ic_launcher.png  

## Copilot
I hear you. Let's make sure your `logo.png` is shining from the `drawable` folder:

1. **Ensure `logo.png` is placed** in:
    - `res/drawable/logo.png`

2. **Update your `AndroidManifest.xml`** to point to the `logo.png` in the `drawable` directory:
```xml
<application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:fullBackupContent="true"
    android:icon="@drawable/logo"
    android:isGame="true"
    android:appCategory="game"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
    tools:ignore="UnusedAttribute">
```

Now, clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio, and you should see your shiny new logo in action. Let’s give it a whirl and see how it looks!  

## Me
I still have the same structure as before, I want to use logo.png and logo.xml to get my new logo as the icon in various circumstance [Uploaded Image Expired]  

## Copilot
Got it! Let’s make sure your logo fits perfectly in different scenarios. Here's how you can incorporate `logo.png` and `logo.xml`:

1. **Create the necessary drawables**:
   Ensure your logo images are in `res/drawable` for different densities:
   - `res/drawable-mdpi/logo.png`
   - `res/drawable-hdpi/logo.png`
   - `res/drawable-xhdpi/logo.png`
   - `res/drawable-xxhdpi/logo.png`
   - `res/drawable-xxxhdpi/logo.png`

2. **Setup `logo.xml`**:
   Make sure your `logo.xml` correctly references your logo:
   ```xml
   <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
       <item android:drawable="@android:color/white"/>
       <item>
           <bitmap
               android:gravity="center"
               android:src="@drawable/logo"/>
       </item>
   </layer-list>
   ```

3. **Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**:
   Point to your `logo.xml` as the icon:
   ```xml
   <application
       android:allowBackup="true"
       android:fullBackupContent="true"
       android:icon="@drawable/logo"
       android:isGame="true"
       android:appCategory="game"
       android:label="@string/app_name"
       android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
       tools:ignore="UnusedAttribute">
   ```

4. **Add adaptive icons** (optional):
   If you need adaptive icons, set up:
   - `res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/logo.xml`:
   ```xml
   <adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
       <background android:drawable="@drawable/logo"/>
       <foreground android:drawable="@drawable/logo_foreground"/>
   </adaptive-icon>
   ```

5. **Rebuild your project**:
   Clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio to apply the changes.

This should update your app’s icon using `logo.png` in different contexts and ensure consistency across all devices. Give it a shot!

## Me
How would I update logo_foreground.xml, I previously showed what values are in there  

## Copilot
You’ve got it. To make sure your `logo_foreground.xml` correctly references your new `logo.png`, here’s what you can do:

1. **Update `logo_foreground.xml`** to use your new logo:
```xml
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:width="108dp"
    android:height="108dp"
    android:viewportWidth="108"
    android:viewportHeight="108">
    <path
        android:pathData="M0,0h108v108H0z"
        android:fillColor="@android:color/transparent"/>
    <path
        android:pathData="M22,48.667l2.987,0l0,10.667l-2.987,0z"
        android:fillColor="#000000"
        android:strokeColor="#00000000"
        android:fillAlpha="1"/>
    <!-- Adjust other pathData elements as necessary -->
</vector>
```

Make sure to adjust the `pathData` elements to fit your specific design requirements, but keep the `vector` dimensions consistent with your desired logo size. This ensures that your app will properly display the new logo as the foreground icon.

After making these changes, clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio to see the updated logo.

Give it a try and see how it looks!

## Me
How do I adjust the pathData elements for all of the logo.png files I just showed in my strcuture?  

## Copilot
To adjust the pathData elements for your `logo_foreground.xml` to match your `logo.png` files across various densities, you'll need to convert your logo image into a vector format, which will generate the necessary path data. 

Here’s a general approach:

1. **Use an Image to Vector Converter**: Tools like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or online converters (like Vector Magic) can help.
    - Import your `logo.png` into the tool.
    - Use the tool to trace the bitmap and create a vector graphic.
    - Export the result as an SVG file.

2. **Convert SVG to Android Vector Drawable**:
    - You can use online tools like `SVG2VectorDrawable` to convert your SVG into an Android-compatible vector drawable XML file.
    - Replace your current path data with the one generated.

3. **Replace Path Data in `logo_foreground.xml`**:
    - Open the converted vector drawable XML file.
    - Copy the path data and other necessary attributes.
    - Replace the corresponding sections in your `logo_foreground.xml`.

Here’s a simplified example of what your `logo_foreground.xml` might look like after updating:
```xml
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:width="108dp"
    android:height="108dp"
    android:viewportWidth="108"
    android:viewportHeight="108">
    <path
        android:pathData="M10,10L50,50L90,10Z"
        android:fillColor="#000000"/>
    <!-- Add more path data here as needed -->
</vector>
```

**Clean and rebuild your project** in Android Studio to see the updated icons in action.

Give this a go, and you should see your new logo perfectly integrated as a vector drawable.

## Me
Can I have the full example for my use case?  

## Copilot
Absolutely. Let’s put this all together for you.

1. **Ensure `logo.png` files are in the `res/drawable` folders for various screen densities**:
    - `res/drawable-mdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/drawable-hdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/drawable-xhdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/drawable-xxhdpi/logo.png`
    - `res/drawable-xxxhdpi/logo.png`

2. **Create `logo.xml` to reference the new logo**:
```xml
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@android:color/white"/>
    <item>
        <bitmap
            android:gravity="center"
            android:src="@drawable/logo"/>
    </item>
</layer-list>
```

3. **Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to use `logo.xml`**:
```xml
<application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:fullBackupContent="true"
    android:icon="@drawable/logo"
    android:isGame="true"
    android:appCategory="game"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
    tools:ignore="UnusedAttribute">
```

4. **Create `logo_foreground.xml` for adaptive icons**:
```xml
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:width="108dp"
    android:height="108dp"
    android:viewportWidth="108"
    android:viewportHeight="108">
    <!-- Add pathData elements here after converting your logo.png to SVG and then to vector drawable -->
    <path
        android:pathData="M22,48.667l2.987,0l0,10.667l-2.987,0z"
        android:fillColor="#000000"

        android:fillAlpha="1"/>
    <path
        android:pathData="M31.813,48.667L31.813,52.72 31.813,55.067 31.813,56.767 31.813,59.333l2.992,0 2.117,0c1.654,0 2.998,-1.481 2.998,-3.307 0,-1.826 -1.344,-3.307 -2.998,-3.307l-2.117,0L34.805,48.667ZM34.805,55.067l1.269,0c0.469,0 0.848,0.384 0.848,0.853 0,0.469 -0.379,0.847 -0.848,0.847l-1.269,0z"

        android:strokeColor="#00000000"
        android:fillAlpha="1"/>
    <!-- Continue adding other paths as necessary -->
</vector>
```

5. **(Optional) Create an adaptive icon `logo.xml` for anydpi**:
```xml
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <background android:drawable="@drawable/logo"/>
    <foreground android:drawable="@drawable/logo_foreground"/>
</adaptive-icon>
```

6. **Rebuild your project**:
   Clean and rebuild your project in Android Studio to apply all the changes.

This should cover all bases for using `logo.png` and `logo.xml` effectively. Hope this does the trick!

## Me
(Now Monday, Oct 28)  
When I put the following code in my logo.xml, I get an error saying that logo isn't allowed to reference itself:  

```xml
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@android:color/white"/>
  <item> <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/logo"/>
  </item>
</layer-list>
```

## Copilot
This error makes sense because the `logo.xml` is referencing itself, which causes a loop. Let's correct this by not directly referencing `logo.xml` within itself. Instead, you can reference the `logo.png` directly.

Here's a solution:
1. Ensure `logo.png` files are in the `res/drawable` folder.
2. Update `logo.xml` to:
```xml
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:drawable="@android:color/white"/>
    <item>
        <bitmap
            android:gravity="center"
            android:src="@drawable/logo"/>
    </item>
</layer-list>
```
**Note:** Ensure there is no loop by not referencing `logo.xml` within itself.

Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to point to `logo.xml`:
```xml
<application
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:fullBackupContent="true"
    android:icon="@drawable/logo"
    android:isGame="true"
    android:appCategory="game"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
    tools:ignore="UnusedAttribute">
```

This setup ensures no self-referencing loop and appropriately uses `logo.png`. Now, clean and rebuild your project. This should solve the referencing issue.

Feedback: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=192708  

## Copilot
It sounds like you're encountering a **resource cycle** issue in your Android project. This error occurs when a drawable resource references itself, either directly or indirectly, which can lead to runtime exceptions.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Drawable References**: Ensure that none of your drawable XML files reference themselves or create a loop in references. For example, if you have a drawable file `my_image.xml`, it should not reference `my_image.xml` within itself.

2. **Clean and Rebuild Project**: Sometimes, simply cleaning and rebuilding your project can resolve resource-related issues. You can do this by going to `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project` in Android Studio.

3. **Check for Typos**: Make sure there are no typos in your drawable file names and references. Even a small typo can cause this error.

4. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that all your project dependencies are up to date. Sometimes, outdated dependencies can cause unexpected issues.

5. **Review Resource Definitions**: Carefully review your resource definitions to ensure there are no cycles. This includes checking for any indirect references that might create a loop.

If you've tried these steps and are still encountering the error, could you share a snippet of the problematic drawable XML file? That way, I can help you troubleshoot further.

## Me
Where should logo.xml be and how do I then reference logo.png diretly instead?  

## Copilot
The `logo.xml` file should be placed in the `res/drawable` directory of your Android project. To reference `logo.png` directly instead, you can follow these steps:

1. Place the `logo.png` file in the `res/drawable` directory.
2. Reference `logo.png` in your XML layouts or other resource files using the following syntax: `@drawable/logo`.

For example, if you want to use `logo.png` in an `ImageView` in your layout XML file, you can do it like this:

```xml
<ImageView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:src="@drawable/logo" />
```

This way, your `logo.png` will be directly referenced without needing to create an intermediate `logo.xml` file. Any other questions about your project? Let's dive deeper.  

## Me
I want to use logo.png as the front facing icon for my app  

## Copilot
Got it. To set `logo.png` as the app icon, follow these steps:

1. **Place `logo.png` in the correct directory**:
   - Add your `logo.png` to the `res/mipmap` directory. You might have different subfolders here (like `mipmap-hdpi`, `mipmap-mdpi`, etc.). You should add appropriately sized versions of your logo to each of these folders to support different screen resolutions.

2. **Update your `AndroidManifest.xml`**:
   - Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, and within the `<application>` tag, set the `android:icon` attribute to reference your logo. It should look something like this:

```xml
<application
    android:icon="@mipmap/logo"
    ... >
```

3. **Clean and Rebuild Your Project**:
   - Go to `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project` in Android Studio to ensure the changes are applied.

That should set `logo.png` as your app icon. Anything else you want to tweak or explore in your app?  

## Me
How do I add the version number to the app and in which file?  

## Copilot
To add the version number to your Android app, you need to edit the `build.gradle` file. Here's how:

1. **Open `build.gradle (Module: app)`**:
   This file is located under the "Gradle Scripts" section in your Android Studio project view.

2. **Find the `defaultConfig` block**:
   In this block, you can set the version information. You’ll see something like this:

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 30
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.your.package.name"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 30
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    ...
}
```

3. **Set `versionCode` and `versionName`**:
   - `versionCode`: Increment this integer value for every release. This is used internally and not shown to users.
   - `versionName`: Set this to a string that represents the version name shown to users.

For example:
```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion 30
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.your.package.name"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 30
        versionCode 2
        versionName "1.1"
    }
    ...
}
```

4. **Sync Your Project**:
   After making these changes, click "Sync Now" in the bar that appears at the top of the file.

By updating the `versionCode` and `versionName` in your `build.gradle (Module: app)` file, you control your app's versioning for both internal tracking and user-visible updates. 

Good luck, and let me know if you need any more assistance!

How can I reword and shorten this request for an IT service ticket:  

I previously logged service request 1023584 about this issue, I left the Trust on the 20th of September as my internship ended but have since returned on a part-time basis, this is what the issue was about - "Taskbar notification icons always showing on loginI want specific icons on my taskbar to be in the hidden section, the section that can be shown by a popup arrow on the right hand side of the taskbar. However, every time I shutdown and then log back on or restart and log back on, the icons are showing again. Shortly after logging on, I go to Taskbar settings then Select which icons appear on the taskbar (in the Notification area section) then I toggle the setting Always show all icons in the notification area off. I do this almost every time I log on, but still the setting is automatically turned on when I log on again on another day or another time on the same day. Can you check the default settings for my device and make sure this is always toggled off as it's really annoying, the icons take up extra space on my taskbar and it looks really cramped then."It was recommended that I would have to get a new laptop as my profile was corrupt.

## Copilot
Sure thing, here's a more concise version of your IT service ticket request:

---

**Service Request: 1023584**

I previously left the Trust on September 20th after my internship ended but have returned part-time. My issue is with taskbar notification icons always showing upon login. I need specific icons to be hidden, but they reappear every time I log in, despite toggling the setting to hide them.

It was recommended that I get a new laptop as my profile was corrupt. Ideally, this would be a Windows 11 laptop as part of the BCFT pilot, as I perform a lot of technical work and would benefit from Windows 11 features.

Thank you for your assistance.

This should cover all the necessary details succinctly.  

## Me
How about a one line summary of the request  

## Copilot
**Service Request Summary:** Issue with taskbar notification icons resetting on login; requesting a new Windows 11 laptop due to a corrupt profile.

How's that?  

## Me
Could you reduce that further?  

## Copilot
**Request:** Taskbar icons reset on login; need a Windows 11 laptop due to profile corruption. 

That’s as tight as it gets!

  - Make sub link (usually there – not there if item is Home or if cannot be further subjugated due to there already being 3 levels of items)
  - Promote sub link (only there if an item is already a sub link to push it out a level)
- [ ] Add a navigation item, shows up as a horizontal line with plus sign in middle, brings up new pop-up side menu with different options:
- A drop-down to choose whether the item should be a link or simply a label (non-linked navigation item)
- Address (only available if link is chosen above), text box to paste a webpage address (URL) in to where you want the link to go
- Display name, text box to type in the what should be displayed as the name of the item in the navigation bar
- Open in new tab checkbox (only available if link is chosen above), tick this to allow link to open in new tab automatically, otherwise leave unchecked
- Ok and cancel buttons (self-explanatory)

## Me
I have an ellipse in java, how can I convert it to a Circle while keeping teh similar dimensions?  

## Copilot
Alright, converting an Ellipse to a Circle in Java while maintaining similar dimensions is straightforward. Here’s the approach:

1. **Find the Diameter**:
   Use the shortest dimension of the ellipse (either the width or height) as the diameter of the circle.

2. **Create the Circle**:
   Use the calculated diameter to create a circle. If your ellipse is wider than it is tall, use the height; if it’s taller, use the width.

Here’s a quick example:
```java
import java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D;
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;
import java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D.Double;

public class EllipseToCircle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Original Ellipse
        Ellipse2D ellipse = new Ellipse2D.Double(10, 20, 100, 50); // x, y, width, height

        // Find the diameter (shortest dimension)
        double diameter = Math.min(ellipse.getWidth(), ellipse.getHeight());

        // Create a Circle (use Ellipse2D for simplicity)
        Ellipse2D circle = new Ellipse2D.Double(ellipse.getX(), ellipse.getY(), diameter, diameter);

        System.out.println("Original Ellipse: " + ellipse);
        System.out.println("Converted Circle: " + circle);
    }
}
```

This code snippet converts the ellipse to a circle, keeping the position the same and using the smaller dimension as the diameter. Simple and effective! Give it a try and see how it works out.  

## Me
I want to use a Circle class to reprsent teh converted circle  

## Copilot
Got it! Let's create a `Circle` class and convert the ellipse to a circle using that class.

Here’s an example:

1. **Create the Circle class**:
```java
public class Circle {
    private double x;
    private double y;
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double x, double y, double radius) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public double getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public void setX(double x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    public double getY() {
        return y;
    }

    public void setY(double y) {
        this.y = y;
    }

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    public void setRadius(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Circle{" + "x=" + x + ", y=" + y + ", radius=" + radius + '}';
    }
}
```

2. **Convert Ellipse to Circle**:
Here’s how you can convert an `Ellipse2D` object to a `Circle` using the `Circle` class:
```java
import java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D;

public class EllipseToCircle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Original Ellipse
        Ellipse2D ellipse = new Ellipse2D.Double(10, 20, 100, 50); // x, y, width, height

        // Find the diameter (shortest dimension)
        double diameter = Math.min(ellipse.getWidth(), ellipse.getHeight());

        // Create a Circle
        Circle circle = new Circle(ellipse.getX(), ellipse.getY(), diameter / 2);

        System.out.println("Original Ellipse: " + ellipse);
        System.out.println("Converted Circle: " + circle);
    }
}
```

This code does the following:
1. Defines a `Circle` class with properties `x`, `y`, and `radius`.
2. Converts the ellipse to a circle by using the smallest dimension as the diameter.
3. Instantiates a `Circle` object with the appropriate position and radius.

This way, you maintain similar dimensions while representing the converted shape as a `Circle` object. Try it out and see how it works!

## Me
(Now Thursday, Oct 31)  
I'm trying to perform an exercise for my coursework involving hash tables in computer science. I've been given a primary hash function (h1(x) = x mod 11) and a secondary hash function (h2(x) = (x mod 3) + 1) but both result in a collision. I've found this on Reddit but I need to reference a paper that contains more information about it: H = (H1(k) + i*H2(k))%n  

## Copilot
I found a paper titled **"Collision Resolution Techniques in Hash Table: A Review"** by Ahmed Dalhatu Yusuf, Saleh Abdullahi, Moussa Mahamat Boukar, and Salisu Ibrahim Yusuf. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of various collision resolution techniques, including the use of secondary hash functions.

You can reference this paper for more information on the formula **H = (H1(k) + i*H2(k))%n** and other collision resolution strategies.

Would you like help with anything else related to your coursework?
