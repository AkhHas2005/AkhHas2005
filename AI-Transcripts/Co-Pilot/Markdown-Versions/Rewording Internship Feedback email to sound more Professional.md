How can I reword this email to sound more professional and directed towards Rami instead who was involved in the interview process of my internship and helped facilitate the partnership between university and the internship organisation (Bradford Children's and families trust)?

    Now that the internship has finished, I was wondered if I could get in touch with Dr Rami, the tutor from University who helped facilitate the internship, to give him feedback on how the internship went.  
    
    If you could arrange a Teams call for me with him that I can join from my uni account that would be much appreciated. 
    
    Many thanks,

Now that my internship has concluded, I would like to provide feedback to Dr. Rami, the university tutor who played a crucial role in this collaboration. Could you kindly arrange a Teams call for me with Dr. Rami? I would appreciate it if the call could be scheduled through my university account.

Thank you very much for your assistance.
