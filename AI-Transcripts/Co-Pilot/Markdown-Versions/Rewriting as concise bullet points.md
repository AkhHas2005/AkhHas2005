# Rewriting as concise bullet points  

## Me
can you rewriet this as concise bullet pointed notes, that doesn't indicate any tense of wting (e.g. preterite tense, present tense, future tense) and can be rewritten in teh active voice?  
This report is based on my time as an intern in the local authority-based organisation, the Bradford Children's and Families Trust. What I hoped to gain from this before starting was to gain some experience of a workplace environment and how to approach tasks in this. Also, I wanted to gain some more insights into AI and help the trust with some valuable AI knowledge and skills. I anticipated that my experience will have supported me in progressing my academic career by proving that I can research and start engineering AI solutions for a real-life business and also that I have experience in a workplace environment.  

I have learnt quite a bit about the processes and practices involved in researching AI while working at BCFT. I've come across some of the challenges and had meetings with various professionals from different areas of the trust. I've also been directed to various sources that can help me with my research and have utilised those resources to begin to think of possible solutions.  
The organisation has been very supportive, offering a mentor I can talk to and hold meetings with and explaining things to me cohesively. I have been part of a small team and learnt many things from different members of the team on how the system works and how the trust operates. I have been treated fairly. Everyone has been welcoming and inclusive. This has only added to my confidence and has helped to develop it. As mentioned, I've had meetings with different members of the trust and learnt about the various challenges they face and how AI can be developed to help them.
