Certainly! Let's break it down:

1. **The Three Switches (Light Bulbs):**
   - You have three switches and three light bulbs in separate rooms.
   - You can't see the bulbs from where you are.
   - You can flip the switches as many times as you want, but you can only enter the room with the bulbs once.
   - How can you determine which switch controls which bulb?

   **Hint:** Consider using the time it takes for bulbs to heat up or cool down as an indicator without having all switches on at once.

2. **The Bridge and Torch Problem:**
   - Four people need to cross a bridge at night.
   - They have one torch, and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without it.
   - The bridge can only hold two people at a time.
   - Each person walks at a different speed: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 7 minutes, and 10 minutes.
   - When two people cross together, they must go at the slower person's pace.
   - How can all four people get across the bridge in 17 minutes?

   **Your solution seems correct**, but there's a small typo: "two minyte" should be "two minute." Also, ensure that your total time calculation aligns with this strategy.

3. **The Two Doors (Guard Riddle):**
   - You are in a room with two doors.
   - One door leads to certain death, and the other leads to freedom.
   - There are two guards‚Äîone by each door.
   - One guard always tells the truth, and the other always lies.
   - You can ask one guard one question to determine which door leads to freedom.
   - What do you ask?

   **Your strategy is sound.** By asking if "the other guard is guarding the door of death," you're using logical deduction based on their responses to determine which door leads to freedom.

Give these a try, and feel free to ask for more hints or solutions if needed! üòä

## Me
What is the right answer for the 3rd riddle?  

## Co-Pilot
The correct question to ask the guards in the third riddle is: "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?" Then, choose the opposite door from their answer.

This way, you'll get the correct information regardless of whether you're speaking to the truth-telling guard or the lying guard. Good luck! üö™üîí

Certainly! Here are three more riddles that you might enjoy:

1. **Three Light Bulbs & Switches:**
   - You are in a room with **three switches** in the basement. Two of them are useless, while one is connected to a lightbulb in the attic.
   - Your task is to determine which switch controls the attic lightbulb and remove the other two.
   - Solution: Switch on any two switches (e.g., 1 & 2), wait a minute, then switch off one of them (e.g., 2). Check the attic: the bulb that's on corresponds to the switch left on, the hot bulb is connected to the switched-off switch, and the third bulb is wired to the remaining switch[^1^][1].

2. **Bridge & Torch Problem:**
   - Four travelers (A, B, C, and D) need to cross a bridge at night.
   - They have one torch, and the bridge can only hold two people at a time.
   - Each person walks at a different speed: A (1 minute), B (2 minutes), C (5 minutes), and D (8 minutes).
   - How can the entire group get to the other side of the bridge before the torch burns out (within 15 minutes)?[^2^][2]

3. **Basement Lightbulb Riddle (Alternative Form):**
   - Imagine you're renovating a building. In the basement, there are three switches, but only one of them is connected to a lightbulb in the attic.
   - Your goal is to identify the switch that controls the attic light.
   - Solution: Turn on switches 1 & 2, wait a minute, then turn off switch 2. Check the attic: the bulb that's on corresponds to the switch left on, the hot bulb is connected to the switched-off switch, and the third bulb is wired to the remaining switch (similar to the first riddle).[^1^][1]
