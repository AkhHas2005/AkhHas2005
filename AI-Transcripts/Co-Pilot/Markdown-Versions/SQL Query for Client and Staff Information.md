# SQL Query for Client and Staff Information  

## Me
Can you write the SQl statement for this problem:  
Display all the clients, showing the client name, clientâ€™s city, country, the sales representative staff that is in charge of them, displaying the staff name (first and last name concatenated), staff city, staff country, for all the clients that are located in a city that is different from the city where the office of the staff is.  

## Co-Pilot
Sure, I can help with that. Hereâ€™s an SQL statement that matches your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    clients.client_name, 
    clients.city AS client_city, 
    clients.country AS client_country, 
    CONCAT(staff.first_name, ' ', staff.last_name) AS staff_name,
    staff.city AS staff_city,
    staff.country AS staff_country
FROM 
    clients
JOIN 
    staff 
ON 
    clients.staff_id = staff.staff_id
WHERE 
    clients.city <> staff.city;
```

This SQL statement does the following:

- Selects the client's name, city, and country.
- Joins the clients table with the staff table using the staff_id.
- Concatenates the staff's first and last name.
- Filters the results to only include clients whose city is different from the staff's city.

Why is this statemnet wronhg and hopw many marks out of 10 should I get for it?  

    SELECT `clientName`, `rclients`.`city`, `rclients`.`country`, `rstaff`.`firstName`, `rstaff`.`lastName`, `roffices`.`city`, `roffices`.`country` 
    FROM `rclients`, `rstaff`, `roffices` 
    WHERE `rclients`.`salesRepStaffNo` = `rstaff`.`staffNo` AND `rstaff`.`officeCode` = `roffices`.`officeCode` AND NOT `rclients`.`city` = `roffices`.`city`;  

## Co-Pilot
Let's take a closer look at your SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT `clientName`, `rclients`.`city`, `rclients`.`country`, `rstaff`.`firstName`, `rstaff`.`lastName`, `roffices`.`city`, `roffices`.`country` 
FROM `rclients`, `rstaff`, `roffices` 
WHERE `rclients`.`salesRepStaffNo` = `rstaff`.`staffNo` 
AND `rstaff`.`officeCode` = `roffices`.`officeCode` 
AND NOT `rclients`.`city` = `roffices`.`city`;
```

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Use of Table Aliases**: You've used `rclients`, `rstaff`, and `roffices` as table names. Assuming these are aliases and not the actual table names, typically you would define these aliases in the `FROM` clause after the actual table names.
2. **Concatenation of Staff Name**: You are selecting `rstaff`.`firstName` and `rstaff`.`lastName` separately. To match the requirement, you should concatenate these fields.
3. **Join Syntax**: Using the `FROM ... WHERE` join syntax is valid but not as clear and explicit as using `JOIN ... ON`.

Here's a corrected version of your SQL statement using better practices:

```sql
SELECT 
    `clients`.`clientName`, 
    `clients`.`city` AS client_city, 
    `clients`.`country` AS client_country, 
    CONCAT(`staff`.`firstName`, ' ', `staff`.`lastName`) AS staff_name, 
    `staff`.`city` AS staff_city, 
    `staff`.`country` AS staff_country 
FROM 
    `rclients` AS clients
JOIN 
    `rstaff` AS staff 
ON 
    clients.salesRepStaffNo = staff.staffNo
JOIN 
    `roffices` AS offices 
ON 
    staff.officeCode = offices.officeCode
WHERE 
    clients.city <> offices.city;
```

### Marking
Considering these points:
- **Correctness**: 6/10
  - The basic structure and logic are in place, but the join syntax and missing name concatenation are important details.
- **Readability and Best Practices**: 2/10
  - Using explicit `JOIN` clauses is generally better practice, and concatenating the staff names as requested.

Overall, itâ€™s a good start! Keep practicing, and youâ€™ll nail it. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!  

## Me
My teacher gave 0 out of 10 for it, is that a really harsh mark?  

## Co-Pilot
That does seem a bit strict, considering the effort you put in. However, teachers often have specific criteria theyâ€™re grading against, which might include not only correctness but also best practices and clarity.

You did have the right idea with your logic and structure, but there were a few key elements that needed adjustment, like using explicit joins and concatenating the staff names. Itâ€™s possible your teacher was looking for these specific improvements.

In the end, feedback, even harsh, is a chance to learn and improve. The important part is understanding what needs to be fixed and how to apply that knowledge moving forward. If you need further clarification on the improvements, Iâ€™m here to help! Letâ€™s turn that 0 into a 10 next time. ðŸ’ª

How about for this?  
Write a query to show the selling values realised by each staff member, considering that the purchase orders from a client are linked to the staff member that is the sales representative for that client. The SQL query should display the staff number, â€˜Staff nameâ€™ (concatenating first and last name), job title, order number, client name, product code and â€˜Items selling valueâ€™ as calculated column (product between price per each item and quantity ordered).  

## Co-Pilot
Sure! Let's create the SQL query for this:

```sql
SELECT 
    staff.staffNo, 
    CONCAT(staff.firstName, ' ', staff.lastName) AS staff_name, 
    staff.jobTitle, 
    orders.orderNumber, 
    clients.clientName, 
    order_details.productCode, 
    (order_details.priceEach * order_details.quantityOrdered) AS Items_selling_value
FROM 
    staff
JOIN 
    clients 
ON 
    staff.staffNo = clients.salesRepStaffNo
JOIN 
    orders 
ON 
    clients.clientNo = orders.clientNo
JOIN 
    order_details 
ON 
    orders.orderNumber = order_details.orderNumber
ORDER BY 
    staff.staffNo;
```

This SQL query does the following:

1. **Selects** the required fields including staff number, concatenated staff name, job title, order number, client name, and product code.
2. **Calculates** the selling value for each item by multiplying the price per each item by the quantity ordered.
3. **Joins** the `staff`, `clients`, `orders`, and `order_details` tables to link all the necessary information.
4. **Orders** the results by staff number.

Feel free to tweak it if you have more specific requirements! If you need any further assistance, I'm here to help.  

## Me
These are my table nbames, can you please amend the sql statement? [Uploaded Image Expired]  

## Co-Pilot
Absolutely, let's update the SQL statement using the table names you've provided. Here's the amended version:

```sql
SELECT 
    staff.staffNo, 
    CONCAT(staff.firstName, ' ', staff.lastName) AS staff_name, 
    staff.jobTitle, 
    orders.orderNumber, 
    clients.clientName, 
    orderdetails.productCode, 
    (orderdetails.priceEach * orderdetails.quantityOrdered) AS Items_selling_value
FROM 
    rstaff AS staff
JOIN 
    rclients AS clients 
ON 
    staff.staffNo = clients.salesRepStaffNo
JOIN 
    rpurchaseorders AS orders 
ON 
    clients.clientNo = orders.clientNo
JOIN 
    rorderdetails AS orderdetails 
ON 
    orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber
ORDER BY 
    staff.staffNo;
```

In this query:
- `rstaff` is aliased as `staff`
- `rclients` is aliased as `clients`
- `rpurchaseorders` is aliased as `orders`
- `rorderdetails` is aliased as `orderdetails`

This should match your table structure. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!

How about this one?  
Write a query to show the â€˜Total selling valuesâ€™ realised by each staff member that has sales of more than 500000. Consider in the total for one staff member all the orders from the clients that have that staff member as sales representative. The SQL query should display the staff number, â€˜Staff nameâ€™ (concatenating first and last name), job title and â€˜Total selling valueâ€™ as calculated column (the sum of all products between price per each item and quantity ordered) and the results should be sorted descending by the total selling value.  

## Copilot
Alright! Let's create an SQL query that fits your requirements. We'll be calculating the total selling values for each staff member, considering only those who have total sales exceeding 500,000. The query will display the staff number, concatenated staff name, job title, and the total selling value, sorted in descending order by the total selling value:

```sql
SELECT 
    staff.staffNo, 
    CONCAT(staff.firstName, ' ', staff.lastName) AS staff_name, 
    staff.jobTitle, 
    SUM(orderdetails.priceEach * orderdetails.quantityOrdered) AS total_selling_value
FROM 
    rstaff AS staff
JOIN 
    rclients AS clients 
ON 
    staff.staffNo = clients.salesRepStaffNo
JOIN 
    rpurchaseorders AS orders 
ON 
    clients.clientNo = orders.clientNo
JOIN 
    rorderdetails AS orderdetails 
ON 
    orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber
GROUP BY 
    staff.staffNo, staff.firstName, staff.lastName, staff.jobTitle
HAVING 
    SUM(orderdetails.priceEach * orderdetails.quantityOrdered) > 500000
ORDER BY 
    total_selling_value DESC;
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. **Selects** the required fields including staff number, concatenated staff name, job title, and the total selling value.
2. **Joins** the `rstaff`, `rclients`, `rpurchaseorders`, and `rorderdetails` tables.
3. **Calculates** the total selling value for each staff member.
4. **Groups** the results by staff number, first name, last name, and job title.
5. **Filters** the results to include only those with total sales exceeding 500,000 using the `HAVING` clause.
6. **Sorts** the results in descending order by the total selling value.

Sure! Hereâ€™s the SQL query tailored to your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    staff.staffNo, 
    CONCAT(staff.firstName, ' ', staff.lastName) AS staff_name, 
    staff.jobTitle, 
    orders.orderNumber, 
    clients.clientName, 
    orderdetails.productCode, 
    (orderdetails.priceEach * orderdetails.quantityOrdered) AS items_selling_value
FROM 
    rstaff AS staff
JOIN 
    rclients AS clients 
ON 
    staff.staffNo = clients.salesRepStaffNo
JOIN 
    rpurchaseorders AS orders 
ON 
    clients.clientNo = orders.clientNo
JOIN 
    rorderdetails AS orderdetails 
ON 
    orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber
ORDER BY 
    staff.staffNo;
```

This query includes:

- Selecting the staff number, concatenated staff name, job title, order number, client name, product code, and the calculated selling value for each item.
- Using `JOIN` clauses to link the necessary tables (`rstaff`, `rclients`, `rpurchaseorders`, `rorderdetails`).
- Calculating the selling value for each item by multiplying `priceEach` with `quantityOrdered`.

clientNo should be clientNumber and I want to show the staff name as stffName  

## Copilot
Got it! Let's update the SQL query with your changes:

```sql
SELECT 
    staff.staffNo, 
    CONCAT(staff.firstName, ' ', staff.lastName) AS stffName, 
    staff.jobTitle, 
    orders.orderNumber, 
    clients.clientName, 
    orderdetails.productCode, 
    (orderdetails.priceEach * orderdetails.quantityOrdered) AS items_selling_value
FROM 
    rstaff AS staff
JOIN 
    rclients AS clients 
ON 
    staff.staffNo = clients.salesRepStaffNo
JOIN 
    rpurchaseorders AS orders 
ON 
    clients.clientNumber = orders.clientNumber
JOIN 
    rorderdetails AS orderdetails 
ON 
    orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber
ORDER BY 
    staff.staffNo;
```

This version uses `clientNumber` instead of `clientNo` and renames the concatenated staff name column to `stffName`. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything else youâ€™d like to tweak!

Write a query to display for each manager how many persons he/she is managing, showing: the managerâ€™s staff number as â€˜Manager IDâ€™, the manager name (first and last name), the number of supervised staff using the alias â€˜Manages # employeesâ€™.  

## Copilot
Let's create the SQL query to display the number of employees each manager supervises. We need to assume there is a table that indicates which manager is in charge of which employees, possibly via a `managerStaffNo` or similar column in the staff table.

Here's the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    manager.staffNo AS `Manager ID`, 
    CONCAT(manager.firstName, ' ', manager.lastName) AS manager_name, 
    COUNT(employee.staffNo) AS `Manages # employees`
FROM 
    rstaff AS manager
LEFT JOIN 
    rstaff AS employee 
ON 
    manager.staffNo = employee.managerStaffNo
WHERE 
    manager.jobTitle = 'Manager'
GROUP BY 
    manager.staffNo, manager.firstName, manager.lastName;
```

This query:
- Selects the manager's staff number as `Manager ID` and concatenates the manager's first and last names.
- Counts the number of employees each manager supervises.
- Joins the `rstaff` table on itself to match managers with their employees.
- Filters the results to include only rows where the manager's job title is 'Manager'.
- Groups the results by the manager's staff number and name to count the number of supervised employees.

Feel free to adjust if you have specific table structures or additional requirements!
