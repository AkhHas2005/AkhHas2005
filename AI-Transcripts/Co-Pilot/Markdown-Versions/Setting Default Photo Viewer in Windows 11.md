# Setting Default Photo Viewer in Windows 11  

## Me
I'm currently on my work laptop and trying to open a photo in the default Windows Gallery on Windows 11, however I can't find it when I open teh photo (default app is set to Paint at the moment). I've gone to browse for more apps to open it, but I'm not sure where the programme file is located or what it's aclled. Can you assist me with this?

Absolutely, Hasan — I’ve got you covered.

🖼️ **Default Photo Viewer in Windows 11**  
The default app for viewing photos in Windows 11 is called **Photos**. It’s a built-in Microsoft app, not a standalone `.exe` you can easily browse to like Paint or Notepad. That’s why it doesn’t show up as a typical program file when you try to locate it manually.

🔍 **How to Set Photos as the Default Viewer Again**  
Here’s the easiest way to switch back:

1. **Right-click** on any image file (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
2. Select **Open with > Choose another app**.
3. Scroll down and click **More apps**.
4. If you see **Photos**, select it. If not, scroll further and click **Look for another app on this PC** — but this won’t help in this case because Photos is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) app, not a traditional `.exe`.
5. Once you select **Photos**, check the box that says **Always use this app to open .jpg files** (or whatever format you're using).
6. Click **OK**.

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings > Apps > Default apps**, search for “Photos,” and assign it to all image formats you want it to handle.[1. Into Windows](https://www.intowindows.com/3-ways-to-change-default-image-viewer-in-windows-11/?utm_source=copilot.com)  

Let me know if you’d like help restoring the classic Windows Photo Viewer instead — it’s hidden but still accessible with a few tweaks.

Great question, Hasan — here are some solid photo viewer options that you can use on Windows 11 **without needing admin rights**, thanks to their **portable versions**:

### 🧳 Portable Photo Viewers (No Admin Required)

| App Name        | Features                                                                 | How to Use Without Admin |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **IrfanView Portable** | Lightweight, fast, supports many formats, basic editing tools             | Download the [portable version](https://www.irfanview.com/) and run the `.exe` directly |
| **XnView MP Portable** | Advanced image viewer with batch processing and metadata support         | Get the [portable ZIP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/) and extract to a folder |
| **FastStone Image Viewer Portable** | Great for browsing, editing, and organizing photos                    | Use the [portable edition](https://www.faststone.org/) — no install needed |
| **JPEGView Portable** | Minimalist viewer with real-time image processing                         | Download from [PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/jpegview_portable) |

These apps are designed to run directly from a folder — no installation, no admin rights. Just unzip and launch.

Would you like help picking one based on your workflow or preferences (e.g., speed, editing tools, batch viewing)?

What's one that I can use to move through multiple images in a folder?

For smooth folder-based image browsing without admin rights, your best bet is **IrfanView Portable**.

### ✅ Why IrfanView Portable Works Well for Folder Navigation
- **Arrow key navigation**: Easily move through all images in a folder using ← and → keys.
- **Auto folder scan**: When you open one image, it automatically loads the rest in the same folder.
- **Fast and lightweight**: Opens instantly, even with large image sets.
- **No install needed**: Just unzip and run — perfect for work laptops with restrictions.

### 🔧 How to Set It Up
1. Download the portable version from [IrfanView's official site](https://www.irfanview.com).
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder you can access.
3. Open any image using IrfanView — it’ll preload the entire folder.
4. Use arrow keys or mouse scroll to move through the gallery.

If you want something with a more modern UI, **XnView MP Portable** is also excellent and supports thumbnail previews, tabs, and batch operations — but IrfanView is faster and simpler for quick folder browsing.
