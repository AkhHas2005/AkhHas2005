Ah, I see! You've got a custom Python script that does a celebratory dance when your laptop reaches full charge, and you're wondering if those victory notifications will shimmy their way onto your phone. Let's dive into this tech tango! üíÉüîåüì±

**Custom Python Script and Phone Link Harmony:**

1. **Phone Link Setup**:
   - First things first: Make sure you have the **Phone Link** app installed on your Windows 11 PC. If you haven't, head to the Microsoft Store and give it a warm welcome.
   - Connect your Android phone to your PC using the **Phone Link** app. Pair them up via Bluetooth‚Äîlike two devices destined for notification greatness.

2. **Notification Magic**:
   - Open your trusty Python script that does the "laptop fully charged" dance. üéâ
   - When your laptop hits that sweet 100%, your script should trigger a Windows 11 notification. You know, the kind that says, "Hey, I'm fully charged! Ready to conquer the world!"
   - Now, here's where the Phone Link waltz comes in: If your script sends a notification to your PC, it'll also show up on your phone. üì≤

3. **Fine-Tuning the Dance Moves**:
   - Within the **Phone Link** app on your PC, you can customize your notification experience:
     - Go to **Settings** (click that little gear icon‚Äîyou know the drill).
     - Under **Features**, find **Notifications**.
     - Turn on **Show notification banners on my PC**. This ensures that when your laptop does its victory lap, your phone gets the memo too.
     - If you're feeling extra fancy, explore other notification settings. Maybe even teach your phone to do a mini moonwalk when it receives notifications. üåô

4. **Real-Time Sync**:
   - Whenever your Python script triggers a notification on your laptop, it'll gracefully pirouette onto your phone screen. üåü
   - And guess what? If you delete that notification on your PC (because, let's face it, you're a digital decluttering pro), it'll vanish from your phone too. Sync magic!

5. **Bonus Encore: Audio Controls**:
   - Oh, and here's a secret encore: The **Phone Link** app lets you groove to audio from your phone. üé∂
   - If your Python script plays a victory anthem (or any other audio) when your laptop hits 100%, make sure notifications are enabled for that audio app on your phone.
   - On your PC, in the **Phone Link** settings, toggle on "Show audio currently playing from my phone."
   - Now, when your laptop celebrates, the music will flow seamlessly to your phone. üéµ

Remember, audio will play from your Android device or any connected speakers‚Äînot from your laptop. So, no impromptu laptop concert! üé§üîä
  
And hey, if your Python script ever decides to moonwalk instead of waltz, I've got troubleshooting tips up my digital sleeve. üõ†Ô∏è

Now go forth, tech virtuoso! May your notifications be timely, your laptop always charged, and your dance moves legendary. If you need more guidance or want to chat about other cool tech stuff, I'm all ears! ü§ìüëÇ[^1^][1] [^2^][2] [^3^][4]

Here are some steps to help you fix the issue:

1. **Relink Phone Link Apps**:

2. **Re-enable Notifications on Your Windows 11/10 Computer**:
   - Double-check that notifications are allowed for the **Phone Link** app on your Windows PC. Head to your PC's settings and make sure it's all green lights for notifications.

3. **Reset Notification Permissions on Phone**:
   - On your Android device:
     - Go to **Settings** and search for **Notification access**.
     - Find **Link to Windows** in the list and toggle it off and then on again.
     - When the popup appears, select **Allow**.
   - On your PC:
     - Open the **Phone Link** app and choose **Notifications**.
     - Wait for your notifications to refresh‚Äîthey should now sync normally.

4. **Turn Off Battery Saver Mode**:
   - Sometimes, our devices get a little too energy-conscious. Make sure your laptop's battery saver mode isn't blocking notifications.

5. **Disable Do Not Disturb Mode**:
   - Check if your phone is in "Do Not Disturb" mode. If it is, notifications might be tiptoeing around it. Let them dance freely!

6. **Generic Fixes for Windows Apps**:
   - You know how sometimes a good ol' restart fixes everything? Apply that wisdom here too. Restart your PC and phone, just to give them a fresh start.

Remember, we're like tech detectives‚Äîsolving mysteries one notification at a time! If you encounter any roadblocks during this troubleshooting dance, don't hesitate to reach out. We'll get those notifications back on track! üöÄüîîüï∫
