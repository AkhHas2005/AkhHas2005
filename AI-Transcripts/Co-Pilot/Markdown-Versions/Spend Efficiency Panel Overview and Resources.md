# Spend Efficiency Panel Overview and Resources  

## Me
How can I summarise this overview of the spend panel process for the introduction of a SharePoint page?  

The Spend Efficiency Panel Process is used to reduce unnecessary spending and triage spending requests for anything work-related over ¬£500. It uses a tiered system of different managers and execs to approve different amounts, the higher the amount, the higher up the approving manager/exec must be in the company structure. There‚Äôs a spreadsheet on TrustNet that shows which budget holders are available for which departments, business areas and amounts.  
The Panel meets daily every morning and is chaired by the assistant director to approve any requests that have recently come through from the form and power automate workflows behind the scenes.  
There are 4 different routes for spend requests and approvals depending on what the request is for and how much needs to be paid. The first one is for Child Placement Care packages (Social care side of things only) and these include only costs directly or indirectly related to the Child Placement. Then there‚Äôs Staff-related changes which cover everything from new post requests, to contract extensions, to filling an existing vacancy. The third route and the last one covered by the SEP Process is for any other payments over ¬£500. This route cover everything not previously mentioned and predominantly consists of Purchase order spending and the request of services/goods not cover by the employee‚Äôs contract. The final route is any spending under ¬£500 and that isn‚Äôt cover by the Panel, instead that can be dealt with by Business Support Finance Officers (BSFOs) who then track the spend and approve it if appropriate.  
After the case study of the first 4 months since the Process went live, the Panel can confidently say that they have ‚Äúenabled more effective processes‚Äù, and this apparently includes ‚Äúscreen and triage of NRPF families to validate eligibility prior to endorsing payments‚Äù. They were able to approve around 85% of over 500 requests with 79% of these being approved with 24 hours and the rest after the request and receival of additional information required for the request.  
There‚Äôs guidance documentation for the requests that tells them how to move through the process. First they navigate to the form and fill out the Requestor name. Then they choose their department from the 4 departments of the Trust. After this the either the division (for Social Care only) or service area appears. There‚Äôs more information on service areas and department managers/directors on the TrustNet spreadsheet that the requestor can refer to if they‚Äôre unsure. After this they choose the relevant budget holder based on the amount they want to request the spend for. Next, they enter the start date for the expenditure and then a specific and recognisable request title. After that the description of reasoning for the expenditure is entered into the form and a couple of Yes/No questions are answered. The Budget Service Area and Cost Code needs to be provided. After this, the Total Value of the spend (excluding VAT) and the time period (e.g. 1 Year, 1 month, One-off) including the dates it covers are provided by the requestor. Supplier and contract details are then filled out to finish the form and is it then submitted to the SEP Panel. One they have submitted the form, they receive an email notification confirming the request and an email is also sent to the relevant budget holder.  
The budget manager can then choose to approve or reject the request at this stage. If they reject the request, the requestor is notified and they can then discuss this with the budget manager to re-consider the request and the requestor resubmits it. If the budget manager approves the request, it is sent to the Spend Request mailbox where BSFOs triage the form to ensure all relevant information is included.  
At the stage where The Spend Panel BSFOs are triaging the form and compiling supporting information they can request more information from the requestor. This is to ensure a swift outcome once the request has been to the Panel. If this is the case, the requestor receives an email specifying the additional information required and how to submit your response. Once the requestor clicks into the request they can then add the additional information that has been requested into the specific box. An automatic email is then sent to the requestor confirming that the further information has been submitted. Once the request is reviewed by the BSFOs, it then progress to the Panel.  
The Panel then meets up and reviews the request, forwarding it to the necessary financial teams and completing any required steps for the request to move forward. The outcomes from the Panel will either be Approved, Rejected or Not Approved ‚Äì Further Information Required. If the expenditure is via Purchase Order, then the requestor is sent an approval email with the Purchase Order number. Alternatively if the expenditure is via Purchase card or any other method, the requestor will receive the approval email with a unique reference number. If the Panel requires further information from the requestor, they will receive an email similar to the Spend Panel BSFO request for more information with the query and link to where to submit the response. If the request is rejected by the panel, an email will be sent that will contain the appeal form as an attachment, any comments from the Panel, and also a link to a form to submit your appeal. The appeal will be sent to the Director of Finance and Resources for their review. Finally, the requestor will receive an email either approving or rejecting the appeal.

## üßæ Introduction to the Spend Efficiency Panel (SEP) Process

The Spend Efficiency Panel (SEP) is a daily governance mechanism designed to reduce unnecessary expenditure and streamline approvals for work-related spending over ¬£500 across BCFT. It operates through a tiered approval system, ensuring that higher-value requests are reviewed by senior budget holders or executives.

### üîÑ Request Routes
There are four distinct approval pathways:
1. **Child Placement Care Packages** ‚Äì Social care-related costs only.
2. **Staff-Related Changes** ‚Äì Includes new posts, contract extensions, and vacancy fills.
3. **Other Spend Over ¬£500** ‚Äì Covers purchase orders and services/goods not tied to employment contracts.
4. **Spend Under ¬£500** ‚Äì Managed by Business Support Finance Officers (BSFOs), outside the SEP process.

### üìä Panel Operations
- The Panel meets every morning, chaired by the Assistant Director.
- Requests are submitted via a digital form and triaged by BSFOs.
- Outcomes include: Approved, Rejected, or Further Information Required.
- Appeals are reviewed by the Director of Finance and Resources.

### üìà Impact & Performance
In its first four months, SEP processed over 500 requests, approving 85% ‚Äî with 79% approved within 24 hours. The process has improved triage efficiency, particularly for NRPF family eligibility checks.

The **Spend Efficiency Panel (SEP)** is a daily governance mechanism designed to streamline approvals and reduce unnecessary expenditure across BCFT. It applies to all work-related spending over ¬£500 and uses a tiered approval structure, where higher-value requests require sign-off from more senior budget holders. The [SEP Terms of Reference](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB4F669ED-7BBA-4B8A-9435-1D15ADD9B38A%7D&file=SEP%20Terms%20of%20Reference%20NOV%2024%20.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) outlines the governance framework and escalation logic.

Requests are submitted via the [Spend Control Panel Approval Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=0N-4KBaqLEGbJrhFuazRqcibXPUW6PpEvyUxBPujzwpURU45OU9CRVNRVkZZWFhKVEVOVFRaR0ZZMC4u&route=shorturl), which triggers a Power Automate workflow and routes the request to the relevant budget holder. If approved, the request is triaged by BSFOs before being reviewed by the Panel. The [SEP Process Diagram](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FBradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet%2FShared%20Documents%2FSpend%20Efficiency%2FSEP%20Process%20as%20041024%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FBradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet%2FShared%20Documents%2FSpend%20Efficiency) and [Process Flow Narrative](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF43189CA-D88C-4C2E-A2D8-BA807144BB8E%7D&file=Spend%20Efficiency%20Panel%20Process%20flow%20narrative%20%20300924%20.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) provide a detailed breakdown of each step.

There are four request routes: Child Placement Care Packages, Staff-Related Changes, Other Spend Over ¬£500, and Spend Under ¬£500 (handled outside the Panel by BSFOs). The [Spend Efficiency Guidance for Requesters](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FBradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet%2FShared%20Documents%2FSpend%20Efficiency%2FBCFT%20Spend%20Efficiency%20Guidance%20for%20Requesters%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FBradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet%2FShared%20Documents%2FSpend%20Efficiency) outlines how to complete the form correctly, including selecting the appropriate department, service area, and budget holder. A [List of Budget Managers](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FBradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet%2FShared%20Documents%2FSpend%20Efficiency%2FList%20of%20Budget%20Managers%20for%20%20SEP%20Go%20live%20141124%20Trust%20Net%20%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FBradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet%2FShared%20Documents%2FSpend%20Efficiency) is available on TrustNet to support this selection.

Once submitted, requestors receive automated email updates at each stage. If further information is required, BSFOs or the Panel will trigger a follow-up email with a link to update the request. Rejected requests can be appealed via the [Spending Panel Appeal Process Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=0N-4KBaqLEGbJrhFuazRqTFtHTUgdAZFvk65nO83KEFUM05VWlRJV1NOM0sxNDdCWEo3Mk9GS0lCTy4u&r93530e326ecd4f4a9f2b7bc935c0fda1), which escalates to the Director of Finance and Resources.

For ongoing maintenance, the [Spend Efficiency Panel TrustNet Page](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/SitePages/Spend-Efficiency-Panels.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=WgS14T) serves as the central hub for updates, while the [FAQs](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/SitePages/Spend-Efficiency-Panel-F.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=Fvw8Bz&CID=c7daf759-0d2c-4ea3-a944-80559883a9a6), [Reference Guide](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BEEC22E7C-1711-4FC2-8EAC-7EAC334D3035%7D&file=SPEND%20EFFICIENCY%20PANEL%20REFERENCE%20GUIDE%20May%202025%20v6%20FINAL.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true), and [Staff Call Update](https://bradfordgovuk.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/BradfordChildrenandFamiliesIntranet/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD1208F8E-FB3E-4C74-8429-A8889A267D7A%7D&file=Spend%20Efficiency%20Panel%20%20update%20for%20all%20staff%20call%20011024.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true) provide additional context and performance insights.

Can you give the overview of a section on the page talking about the test system I made in a similar style based on this information (but without links):  
I created the test system so that we can test any changes or investigate issues without distrupting the live system. It was made by copying Power Automate flows and their various connectors, recreating the requestor form and SharePoint lists, duplicating the spreadsheet and more. As of September 2025, the test system flows are owned by me (Hasan Akhtar) with Tom Beaumont, Helen Gledhill, Jenny Davey and Katie Mistry listed as co-owners. If anyone else needs access to view or edit the flows for the test system, they should notify one of the aforementioned people. Any failed requests in the live system can be replicated by submitting the same details in the test form. This way, teh issue can be confirmed, changes can be tested/trailed in this system and the re-tested and checked if the issue persists.  

## Co-Pilot
Certainly, Hasan ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clean, professional overview of the test system section, written in the same tone and style as your Spend Panel summary and tailored for the App Support Team audience:

## üß™ Test System Overview

To support safe development and troubleshooting of the Spend Efficiency Panel process, a dedicated test environment has been created. This system mirrors the live setup and allows the App Support Team to trial changes, replicate issues, and validate fixes without impacting operational workflows.

The test system includes duplicated Power Automate flows and connectors, a recreated requestor form, cloned SharePoint lists, and a copy of the associated spreadsheet. As of September 2025, the test flows are owned by Hasan Akhtar, with Tom Beaumont, Helen Gledhill, Jenny Davey, and Katie Mistry listed as co-owners. Anyone requiring access to view or edit the flows should contact one of these individuals directly.

Failed or problematic requests from the live system can be replicated in the test form using the same input data. This enables targeted issue investigation, controlled testing of proposed changes, and confirmation of whether a fix resolves the problem. Once validated, updates can be confidently applied to the live environment.

This test system is a key part of our internal application support strategy, ensuring stability, agility, and minimal disruption to users.
