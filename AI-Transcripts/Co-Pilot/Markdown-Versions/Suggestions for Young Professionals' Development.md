# Suggestions for Young Professionals' Development  

## Me
Based on this message conversation, what reas for development could I suggest:  

Hi Hasan, I hope you're good and nice to see you back in the Trust  we're currently setting up a Young Person's Network and wondered if you would like to join? we're very early stages at the moment but will be looking at what skills young people need/ want to develop and trying to faciliate training and opportunities for career development. No worries if its not something you're interested in but it would be helpful to understand how you've found your experience at the Trust so far and if you have any suggestions for how we can encourage young people to apply to the Trust  

Hi Libby, yes I would possibly like to join. I've found the Trust really welcoming and an excellent place to work. I've had decent opportunities for development or growth, however not too much since my role is mainly in software development and there isn't really much of that in the Trust, it's not really a key focus. In terms of suggestions, I'm not really sure at the moment but I'll join and see what's happening  

yeah sounds good! I'm glad you've had a good experience so far! the ypn is really in the early stages (there's 4 of us now including you 😂) there is a wider bradford council one that i can send you the email for is you're interested. we're gonna stay linked to it because there's not that many young people in the public sector so should keep connections but we have different cultures and different needs in terms of development. is there any development in particular you're interested in? i think it would be good to have a list of what young people want and then start lobbying for specific training and opportunities for mentoring and shadowing   

Bear in mind, that I'm a final-year computer science student doing this job as an IT Automation officer in the Trust (Social Care organisation taht seperated from teh local council a couple of year ago but still maintains close relations with teh council and still relies somewhat on their infrastructure - especially IT infrastructure) on the side part-time while I'm still completing my course and don't generally plan on staying after this  

## Co-Pilot
Thanks for the context, Hasan — that helps a lot. Based on your role, your background, and the conversation, here are some thoughtful and strategic **areas for development** you could suggest to the Young Person’s Network (YPN). These would benefit not just you, but other young professionals in similar transitional or tech-adjacent roles:

---

### 💻 1. **Digital Skills & Tech Awareness (for non-tech teams)**
Even if software development isn’t a core focus at the Trust, digital literacy is increasingly vital across all departments. You could suggest:
- Workshops on **automation tools**, **data handling**, or **AI basics** tailored for social care professionals
- Shadowing opportunities with IT or digital transformation teams (including council infrastructure teams)
- Training on **low-code/no-code platforms** for non-technical staff to build simple tools

> This bridges your expertise with the Trust’s broader mission, and helps others see how tech can support care delivery.

---

### 🧭 2. **Career Navigation & Transition Support**
Since you're part-time and not planning to stay long-term, you could advocate for:
- **Career mapping sessions** for young professionals in temporary or transitional roles
- **Mentoring schemes** with professionals in tech, public sector innovation, or digital policy
- **Exit support**: guidance on how to translate public sector experience into private sector or tech industry roles

> This would make the Trust more attractive to students and early-career professionals who see it as a stepping stone.

---

### 🎥 3. **Creative Communication & Branding Skills**
Given your interest in visual storytelling and documentation, you could push for:
- Training in **video production**, **branding**, or **digital storytelling** for internal comms or public engagement
- Opportunities to contribute to **Trust-wide campaigns** that showcase young voices or tech innovation

> This empowers young people to shape how the Trust is perceived and helps them build portfolios.

---

### 🧠 4. **Innovation Labs or Hackathons**
Even if software development isn’t central, you could propose:
- A **mini innovation lab** or **hackathon-style event** where young staff pitch ideas to improve workflows or services
- Cross-functional collaboration between IT, care teams, and young professionals

> This gives visibility to tech-minded staff and encourages creative problem-solving.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 5. **Cross-sector Networking**
Since the Trust is still linked to the council, you could suggest:
- Joint networking events with **Bradford Council’s YPN**
- Panels or roundtables with young professionals from **healthcare, education, and tech sectors**

> This builds bridges and helps young people see broader career paths within public service.

Would you like help drafting a message or proposal to share these ideas with Libby or the YPN group? Or maybe a visual concept to present them more engagingly?  

## Me
(Now Wednesday, Oct 22)  
OK so this was teh last messages in teh conversation about 3 months ago:  

Me: In terms of development, I'm not sure at the moment  

Libby: thats very fair! if you do have any ideas just let me know and i'll add it to the list  

How can I follow-up now, given taht's it's been 3 months and I don't want iyt to feel awkward or out of teh blue  

## Co-Pilot
You can absolutely follow up without it feeling awkward — especially since Libby left the door open for future ideas. Here’s a natural, friendly way to re-engage that acknowledges the time gap while showing initiative:

---

**Message Draft:**

> Hi Libby, hope you're doing well! I’ve been meaning to follow up on the Young Person’s Network — I know it’s been a little while since we last spoke, but I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve got a few ideas around development that might be worth adding to the list.  
>  
> Would it be alright if I shared a few thoughts? I’ve been thinking about how we could support young people in tech-adjacent roles, especially those who might be in transitional or part-time positions like mine.  
>  
> Let me know if you’re still gathering input — happy to contribute!

---

This message:
- Acknowledges the time gap without making it a big deal
- Frames your ideas as helpful and relevant to the YPN’s goals
- Keeps the tone warm, professional, and proactive

Would you like help tailoring the ideas you share next? I can help you phrase them in a way that fits the Trust’s culture and makes a strong case.  

## Me
Ok these are the next messages:  

Libby: Hi! sorry its taken so long to actually get it off the ground but we're going to be launching in 2 weeks and we'll invite everyone on the list we've got but basically the meeting is going to be getting to know everyone and asking what people would want out of the network so you can either send it over to me and/or share in the meeting - it will be the 5th November 1-2pm  

Me: I can share the notes I have, they're mostly tech related but hopefully can help others as well. About the meeting, I won't be working at that time, I only work until around 12pm on Wednesdays so unfortunately won't be able to make it. Thanks for the heads up about the meeting and information about where we currently are with the network  

How can I share the notes then from the previous points you gave me?  

## Co-Pilot
Great — since you've already let Libby know you can't attend the meeting, the best way to share your notes now is with a short, friendly message that frames them as a contribution to the launch. Here's a polished draft you can send:

---

**Message Draft:**

> Hi Libby, hope you're doing well!  
>  
> As promised, I’ve pulled together a few development ideas that might be useful for the Young Person’s Network — they’re mostly tech-focused, but I’ve tried to frame them in a way that could benefit others too.  
>  
> Feel free to share them in the meeting or add them to the list if they’re helpful. I’m glad to see the network getting off the ground — wishing you a great launch on the 5th!  
>  
> **Notes on Development Ideas:**  
> - **Digital Skills & Tech Awareness:** Training for non-tech teams on automation, data handling, and low-code tools.  
> - **Career Navigation Support:** Mentoring and guidance for young professionals in transitional or part-time roles.  
> - **Creative Communication:** Opportunities to learn video production, branding, and digital storytelling for internal comms.  
> - **Innovation Labs or Hackathons:** Events where young staff pitch ideas to improve workflows or services.  
> - **Cross-sector Networking:** Joint events with Bradford Council’s YPN and other public sector teams.  
>  
> Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any of these!

This keeps things warm, professional, and easy to digest. Want help turning this into a visual slide or branded one-pager for extra impact? That could make it stand out even more.  

## Me
(Now Wednesday, Nov 12)  
Ok so now the laucnh of the YPN was last Wednesday but I missed it. What's a polite and professional message I can send to Libby also asking if she used my ideas?  

## Co-Pilot
Here’s a warm, professional message you can send that acknowledges missing the launch, expresses continued interest, and gently asks about your contribution:

---

**Message Draft:**

> Hi Libby, hope the launch went well last Wednesday — sorry I couldn’t make it, I was working earlier that day and missed the session.  
>  
> I just wanted to check in and see how it went, and whether any of the ideas I shared were useful or came up in the discussion. I’m still really interested in how the network develops, so do keep me in the loop if there’s anything I can contribute to or help with remotely.  
>  
> Wishing you and the group all the best as things get going!

---

This keeps the tone friendly and engaged, while giving Libby space to respond without pressure. Would you like help drafting a follow-up if she replies positively? Or maybe a visual version of your ideas to share with the group later on?
