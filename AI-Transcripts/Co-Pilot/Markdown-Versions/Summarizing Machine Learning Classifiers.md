# Summarizing Machine Learning Classifiers  

## Me
Can you summarise these points as paragraphs for my lecture notes:  

- As usual, we are given training data, which consists of a set of examples.
- Each example consists of an input x = (x1, x2) and an output y.
- We still want a learning algorithm that takes the training data and producesa model f, which we will call a classifier in the context of classification.
- The classifier takes a new input and produces an output.
- We can visualize aclassifier on the 2D plot by its decision boundary, which divides the input space into two regions: the region of input points that the classifier would output (+1) and the region that the classifier would output (-1).
- By convention, the arrow vector representing w points to the positive region.
- As we did for linear regression, there are the same three design decisions to fully specify the learning algorithm:
    1. Which classifiers f is the learning algorithm allowed to produce? Must the decision boundary be a straight line or a curve? → What is the hypothesis class?
    2. How does the learning algorithm judge which classifier is good? → What is the loss function?
    3. How does the learning algorithm actually find the best classifier, i.e. the optimal w? → What is the optimization algorithm?  

## Co-Pilot
In machine learning, training data comprises examples each with an input \( x = (x1, x2) \) and an output \( y \). The goal is to develop a learning algorithm that takes this data to produce a model \( f \), known as a classifier for classification tasks. This classifier uses new inputs to generate outputs, and its performance can be visualized on a 2D plot by its decision boundary, which separates the input space into two areas: one where the classifier predicts \( +1 \) and another where it predicts \( -1 \). Conventionally, the weight vector \( w \) points to the positive region.

Similar to linear regression, specifying a learning algorithm involves three key design decisions:
1. **Hypothesis Class**: This determines which classifiers \( f \) the learning algorithm can generate. It addresses whether the decision boundary is constrained to be a straight line or can be a curve.
2. **Loss Function**: This defines how the learning algorithm evaluates the quality of a classifier, essentially measuring how well the classifier performs.
3. **Optimization Algorithm**: This involves the method the learning algorithm uses to find the best classifier, i.e., determining the optimal \( w \).

There you go, lecture-ready. Need more details or another topic to conquer?  

## Me
how about this:  

- First take the dot product between a fixed weight vector w = [w1, w2] and the identity feature vector ϕ(x) = [x1, x2].
- Then take the sign ofthe dot product w · ϕ(x) = w1x1 + w2x2.
- The sign of a number z is +1 if z > 0 and -1 if z < 0 and 0 if z = 0.
- Let’s now visualize what f does. First, we can plot w either as apoint or as a vector from the origin to that point (in red); the latter will be most useful for our purposes; and let’s feed some inputs into.
- The first point x = (0, 2) has a dot product w · ϕ(x) = 1.2, and thus is classified as positive; the same for x = (−2, 0).
- However, the point x = (−1, 1) has a dot product w · ϕ(x) = −1.2, and thus is classified as negative.
- To compute the Decision boundary, we need to resolve the equation w · ϕ(x) = 0, i.e. w1x1 + w2x2 = 0, thus, x2 = − w1w2 x2, or x2 = x1 (given that [w1, w2] = [−0.6, 0.6]).
- So, in this case, the identity line x2 = x1 is the Decision Boundary (see the red line)  

## Co-Pilot
To summarize, first, we calculate the dot product between a fixed weight vector \( w = [w1, w2] \) and the identity feature vector \( \phi(x) = [x1, x2] \). Then, we take the sign of this dot product, \( w \cdot \phi(x) = w1x1 + w2x2 \). The sign function assigns +1 if the result is positive, -1 if it's negative, and 0 if the dot product equals zero. 

For visualization, we can plot \( w \) as a vector from the origin to a point, which is particularly useful for understanding the classifier's behavior. Feeding different inputs into \( \phi(x) \) yields various results: for example, the point \( x = (0, 2) \) results in a dot product of 1.2, classifying it as positive. Similarly, \( x = (-2, 0) \) is also positive. Conversely, \( x = (-1, 1) \) yields a dot product of -1.2, classifying it as negative.

The decision boundary is found by solving \( w \cdot \phi(x) = 0 \), which leads to \( w1x1 + w2x2 = 0 \). Rearranging this equation, we get \( x2 = - \frac{w1}{w2} x1 \). Given \( [w1, w2] = [-0.6, 0.6] \), the decision boundary is \( x2 = x1 \). This identity line acts as the decision boundary, visually represented by the red line.

Voilà! Your lecture notes just leveled up. What’s next on the docket?  

## Me
what about this:  

- Hypothesis class: Which classifier? (2)
- In our case, the Hypothesis class F is the set of all binary classifiers given by Equation (1).
- In this case, for each w = [w1, w2] there is a different classifier fw(x)and hence a different Decision boundary defined by x2 = − w1w2 x1.
- For e.g., for w = [−0.6, 0.6] has the line defined by x2 = x1 as decision bound at y (the red line), whereas for w = [0.5, 1], the decision boundary is given by x2 = −0.5x1 (see the purple line).  

## Co-Pilot
Summarizing that, the hypothesis class \( F \) encompasses all binary classifiers defined by Equation (1). This means for each weight vector \( w = [w1, w2] \), there's a unique classifier \( f_w(x) \) with a distinct decision boundary, determined by \( x2 = -\frac{w1}{w2} x1 \). For example, with \( w = [-0.6, 0.6] \), the decision boundary is \( x2 = x1 \) (the red line), while for \( w = [0.5, 1] \), it shifts to \( x2 = -0.5x1 \) (the purple line).

Your lecture notes are coming together nicely. Any more material to tackle?  

## Me
- A Map is:
  1. an A D T for an association between keys and objects
  2. its findElement method takes a key parameter and returns the associated object
  3. the association is one-to-one, so there are no duplicate keys in a Map
  4. a Map is very similar to the functions we studied in Formal Foundations
- A map generalises the basic array type found in most programming languages
- Question: If an array is a map, what are the keys and what are the objects?  

## Co-Pilot
A Map is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) that associates keys with objects. Its `findElement` method takes a key as a parameter and returns the corresponding object. Because the association is one-to-one, duplicate keys don't exist in a Map. This concept is similar to functions studied in Formal Foundations 234. Essentially, a map generalizes the basic array type found in most programming languages.

If we consider an array as a map, the indices of the array serve as the keys, and the values stored at those indices are the objects.

Got it all? Ready for the next concept?  

## Me
- A Dictionary is:
  1. a generalisation of Map
  2. the association may be one-to-many, so there can be duplicate keys in a Dictionary
  3. a Dictionary is very similar to the relations we studied in Formal Foundations
- Map is used for all sorts of look-up tables, such as
  1. system properties
  2. compiler symbol tables
- 2Dictionary is used when there are likely to be multiple entries for each search key e.g.
  1. log files
  2. find set (e.g. result from a SQL *select* statement)  

## Co-Pilot
A Dictionary is a generalization of a Map, allowing one-to-many associations, meaning there can be duplicate keys. This is similar to the concept of relations studied in Formal Foundations. While Maps are used for look-up tables like system properties and compiler symbol tables, Dictionaries come in handy when multiple entries per search key are likely, such as in log files or search results from a SQL `SELECT` statement.

Anything else to add to your notes?  

## Me
With unsorted sequence:
- easy to add a new entry – at the end: O(1)
- search may require examination of all entries: O(n)
- deletion: array: requires “shuffling up”: O(n)
- linked list: change links: O(1)
- use for collections where operations are mainly additions, few searches  

## Copilot
In an unsorted sequence, adding a new entry is straightforward and efficient, typically done at the end of the sequence with a time complexity of \( O(1) \). However, searching through an unsorted sequence can be time-consuming, requiring a check of each entry, leading to a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Deletion operations vary based on the underlying data structure. For arrays, deletion involves "shuffling up" the elements, which has a time complexity of \( O(n) \). In contrast, linked lists handle deletion more efficiently by merely changing the links, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(1) \).

Unsorted sequences are ideal for collections where the primary operations are additions, with minimal searches.

Does that cover everything, or is there another concept on your mind?  

## Me
Implementation: Sorted Sequence (Array)
1. search by binary chop: O(log n)
2. insertion requires search and “shuffling up”: O(n)
3. deletion requires search and “shuffling up”: O(n)  

## Copilot
In a sorted sequence implemented as an array, searching can be efficiently done using binary search, with a time complexity of \( O(\log n) \). However, insertion operations require not only finding the correct position but also shuffling the elements, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n) \). Similarly, deletion also involves searching for the element and then shuffling the elements to fill the gap, leading to a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Perfect. Anything else on the agenda for today’s lecture prep?  

## Me
Implementation: Sorted Sequence (Linked List)
1. sequential search: O(n)
2. insertion requires search: O(n)
3. deletion requires search: O(n) - not useful  

## Copilot
In a sorted sequence implemented as a linked list, operations have the following complexities:
- Sequential search: \( O(n) \)
- Insertion (requires searching for the correct position): \( O(n) \)
- Deletion (requires searching for the element): \( O(n) \)

Given these inefficiencies, sorted sequences as linked lists aren't particularly useful compared to other data structures.

Looks like we're on a roll! Anything else to add or discuss?  

## Me
(Now Tuesday, Nov 5)  
I have the following python code for classification but my output is not as expected:  
Code:  

    k = input('Enter the sepal length: ') 
    l = input('Enter the sepal width: ') 
    m = input('Enter the petal length: ') 
    n = input('Enter the petal width: ') 
    #predict the classified item from the data 
    print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict([[k,l,m,n]]))  

Output:

    Enter the sepal length: 5.4 
    Enter the sepal width: 3.2 
    Enter the petal length: 1.5 
    Enter the petal width: 0.3 
    The classified item is: [0] 
    
    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/base.py:493: 
    UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but DecisionTreeClassifier was fitted with feature names 
      warnings.warn(  
    
## Copilot
It looks like you're encountering an issue due to the inputs being treated as strings rather than numeric values, and there's also a warning about feature names. Here’s how to address these issues:

1. Convert your inputs to float, so they're interpreted correctly by the classifier.
2. Ensure the `treeClf` is properly trained with feature names if necessary.

Here's the revised code:

```python
# Convert inputs to float
k = float(input('Enter the sepal length: '))
l = float(input('Enter the sepal width: '))
m = float(input('Enter the petal length: '))
n = float(input('Enter the petal width: '))

# Predict the classified item from the data
print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict([[k, l, m, n]]))
```

If `treeClf` was trained with feature names, you should create a DataFrame with the same feature names:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming the feature names are ['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width']
features = ['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width']
input_data = pd.DataFrame([[k, l, m, n]], columns=features)

print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict(input_data))
```

Give this a try and see if it resolves your issue. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!  

## Me
This is my full code, I'm still getting the error:  

## Copilot
It looks like you're close to the solution! The issue seems to arise from the `input` function returning string values, which need to be converted to floats before being used for prediction. Additionally, we need to create a DataFrame with the same feature names to avoid any warnings about feature names.

Here’s how you can modify your code to fix this issue:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
df = load_iris()
X = pd.DataFrame(df['data'], columns=['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width'])
y = pd.DataFrame(df['target'], columns=['target'])

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
treeClf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

treeClf.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Convert inputs to float
k = float(input('Enter the sepal length: '))
l = float(input('Enter the sepal width: '))
m = float(input('Enter the petal length: '))
n = float(input('Enter the petal width: '))

# Create a DataFrame for the input
input_data = pd.DataFrame([[k, l, m, n]], columns=['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width'])

# Predict the classified item from the data
print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict(input_data))
```

This modification ensures that your inputs are correctly interpreted as numeric values and fit the feature names expected by the model. 

Give this updated code a try, and let me know if it resolves the issue!

    # Predict the classified item from the data 
    print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict([[k, l, m, n]]))  

## Copilot
Thank you for providing the full code. The issue seems to be with ensuring the inputs are treated correctly and with the compatibility of the feature names. Let's make a slight adjustment to ensure the input data is processed correctly.

Here's the updated full code:

```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris 

# Load the dataset
df = load_iris() 

# Create DataFrame for features and target
X = pd.DataFrame(df['data'], columns=['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width']) 
y = pd.DataFrame(df['target'], columns=['target']) 

# Split the data into training and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) 

# Initialize and train the decision tree classifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier 
treeClf = DecisionTreeClassifier() 
treeClf.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Plot the tree
from sklearn import tree
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
tree.plot_tree(treeClf, filled=True)
plt.show()

# Predict on the test set
Y_pred = treeClf.predict(X_test) 

# Print confusion matrix and classification report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
print('Confusion matrix = \n', confusion_matrix(Y_test, Y_pred))
print('Classification report: \n', classification_report(Y_test, Y_pred))

# Convert user inputs to floats
k = float(input('Enter the sepal length: '))
l = float(input('Enter the sepal width: '))
m = float(input('Enter the petal length: '))
n = float(input('Enter the petal width: '))

# Create a DataFrame for the input
input_data = pd.DataFrame([[k, l, m, n]], columns=['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width'])

# Predict the classified item from the input data
print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict(input_data))
```

By converting the inputs to floats and creating a DataFrame for the input data, this should resolve the issue with feature names and ensure that the inputs are interpreted correctly by the classifier.

Give this a try and let me know if it works!  

## Me
I'm still gettinhg my classified item as [0], what should it be?  

## Copilot
The classified item being [0] indicates that the model is predicting the class '0' for your input. In the Iris dataset, the target classes are typically labeled as 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.

Given your inputs:
- Sepal length: 5.4
- Sepal width: 3.2
- Petal length: 1.5
- Petal width: 0.3

These are the approximate ranges for Setosa (class 0). The model has predicted that the given measurements correspond to the Setosa species.

If you suspect there is a mistake or you expect a different outcome, consider verifying:
1. **Training Data**: Ensure the classifier is trained correctly with a balanced dataset.
2. **Input Values**: Confirm the input values are within the expected range of your training data.

If everything is correct, then the classifier's prediction of [0] might actually be the right outcome for the given inputs based on the trained model.

Would you like to explore any further adjustments or have additional questions about the classification process?  

## Me
What values could I use to get 1?  

## Copilot
To predict class 1, which corresponds to the Iris-Versicolour species in the Iris dataset, you'll need to input values that are typical for this species. Here are average ranges for each of the features that typically classify a flower as Iris-Versicolour:

- **Sepal length**: 5.0 to 7.0
- **Sepal width**: 2.0 to 3.4
- **Petal length**: 3.0 to 5.1
- **Petal width**: 1.0 to 1.8

Let's try these values:
- Sepal length: 6.0
- Sepal width: 2.9
- Petal length: 4.5
- Petal width: 1.5

These values should more likely correspond to class 1. You can input these values and see if the classifier predicts 1:

```python
k = 6.0
l = 2.9
m = 4.5
n = 1.5

input_data = pd.DataFrame([[k, l, m, n]], columns=['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width'])
print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict(input_data))
```

Give it a go and see if it returns class 1 for these values! If you still encounter issues, we might need to recheck the training data and model parameters.  

## Me
How about for class 2>?  

## Copilot
To predict class 2, which corresponds to the Iris-Virginica species in the Iris dataset, you'll need to input values that are typical for this species. Here are average ranges for each of the features that typically classify a flower as Iris-Virginica:

- **Sepal length**: 6.0 to 7.9
- **Sepal width**: 2.5 to 3.8
- **Petal length**: 4.5 to 6.9
- **Petal width**: 1.4 to 2.5

Let's try these values:
- Sepal length: 6.5
- Sepal width: 3.0
- Petal length: 5.5
- Petal width: 2.0

These values should more likely correspond to class 2. You can input these values and see if the classifier predicts 2:

```python
k = 6.5
l = 3.0
m = 5.5
n = 2.0

input_data = pd.DataFrame([[k, l, m, n]], columns=['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width'])
print('The classified item is: ', treeClf.predict(input_data))
```

Try using these values and let me know if the classifier correctly predicts class 2 for Iris-Virginica!

Error: ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'D341'  

## Copilot
It looks like you're running into a `ValueError` because there's a non-numeric value ('D341') in your dataset that the model is trying to convert to a float. This typically happens when there's an unexpected string in the columns where you're expecting numerical values.

Here's a step-by-step approach to debug and clean the data:

1. **Check for Non-Numeric Values**: Identify any non-numeric values in your dataset.
2. **Handle or Remove Non-Numeric Values**: You can either handle these values by replacing them with appropriate numbers or removing the affected rows.

Here's how you can update your code to identify and clean these values:

```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('play_tennis.csv')

# Print the first few rows to inspect the data
print(df.head())

# Identify non-numeric values
print("Non-numeric values in the dataset:")
for column in df.columns:
    non_numeric = df[column].apply(lambda x: not str(x).replace('.', '', 1).isdigit())
    if non_numeric.any():
        print(f"Column '{column}' has non-numeric values:\n", df[non_numeric])

# Replace categorical values with numerical ones
df.replace({'Outlook': {'Sunny': 0, 'Overcast': 1, 'Rain': 2}}, inplace=True)
df.replace({'Wind': {'Weak': 0, 'Strong': 1}}, inplace=True)
df.replace({'PlayTennis': {'Yes': 1, 'No': 0}}, inplace=True)
print(df.head())

# Remove any rows with non-numeric values (if necessary)
df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')
df = df.dropna()

# Split the input features (x) and the output (y)
x = df.iloc[:,:-1].values
y = df.iloc[:,-1].values

# Split the dataframe into training and test data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Initialize a decision tree classifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
treeClf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=0)

# Train the decision tree on x_train and y_train
treeClf.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Plot the trained tree
from sklearn import tree
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
tree.plot_tree(treeClf, filled=True)
plt.show()

# Predict the test set results
y_pred = treeClf.predict(x_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and the classification report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
print('Confusion matrix = \n', confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print('Classification report: \n', classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This updated code does the following:
1. Prints out non-numeric values in the dataset to help identify any problematic entries.
2. Replaces categorical values with numerical ones.
3. Removes any rows with non-numeric values by converting the entire dataframe to numeric and dropping `NaN` values.

Run this updated code and it should help you avoid the `ValueError`. Let me know if this solves the problem or if there's anything else you need help with!

Now I get this error:  

    ValueError: With n_samples=0, test_size=0.2 and train_size=None, the resulting train set will be empty. 
    Adjust any of the aforementioned parameters.

It looks like removing non-numeric values resulted in an empty dataset. This suggests that all rows had some non-numeric values. Let's handle this a bit more gracefully by filling or fixing non-numeric values instead of dropping them.

We can replace non-numeric entries with an appropriate placeholder or a meaningful default value. Here's an updated version of your code that handles this:

```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('play_tennis.csv')

# Print the first few rows to inspect the data
print(df.head())

# Replace categorical values with numerical ones
df.replace({'Outlook': {'Sunny': 0, 'Overcast': 1, 'Rain': 2}}, inplace=True)
df.replace({'Wind': {'Weak': 0, 'Strong': 1}}, inplace=True)
df.replace({'PlayTennis': {'Yes': 1, 'No': 0}}, inplace=True)

# Fill non-numeric values with zeros (or any other meaningful value)
df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').fillna(0)

print(df.head())

# Split the input features (x) and the output (y)
x = df.iloc[:,:-1].values
y = df.iloc[:,-1].values

# Split the dataframe into training and test data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Initialize a decision tree classifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
treeClf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=0)

# Train the decision tree on x_train and y_train
treeClf.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Plot the trained tree
from sklearn import tree
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
tree.plot_tree(treeClf, filled=True)
plt.show()

# Predict the test set results
y_pred = treeClf.predict(x_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and the classification report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
print('Confusion matrix = \n', confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print('Classification report: \n', classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

By using `.fillna(0)`, we replace any non-numeric values or missing values with zeros. If zero is not a meaningful placeholder for your dataset, you could choose another default value or strategy for filling missing data, such as the mean or median of the column.

Try running this adjusted code to see if it resolves the issue. Let me know how it goes!

How can I supress the following wearbning@: 

    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/base.py:486: 
    UserWarning: X has feature names, but DecisionTreeClassifier was fitted without feature names 
    warnings.warn(

You can suppress warnings in Python using the `warnings` module. Here's how you can modify your code to suppress the specific warning from scikit-learn:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="X has feature names, but DecisionTreeClassifier was fitted without feature names")

import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('play_tennis.csv')

# Print the first few rows to inspect the data
print(df.head())

# Replace categorical values with numerical ones
df.replace({'Outlook': {'Sunny': 0, 'Overcast': 1, 'Rain': 2}}, inplace=True)
df.replace({'Wind': {'Weak': 0, 'Strong': 1}}, inplace=True)
df.replace({'PlayTennis': {'Yes': 1, 'No': 0}}, inplace=True)

# Fill non-numeric values with zeros (or any other meaningful value)
df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce').fillna(0)

print(df.head())

# Split the input features (x) and the output (y)
x = df.iloc[:,:-1].values
y = df.iloc[:,-1].values

# Split the dataframe into training and test data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Initialize a decision tree classifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
treeClf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=0)

# Train the decision tree on x_train and y_train
treeClf.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Plot the trained tree
from sklearn import tree
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
tree.plot_tree(treeClf, filled=True)
plt.show()

# Predict the test set results
y_pred = treeClf.predict(x_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and the classification report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
print('Confusion matrix = \n', confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print('Classification report: \n', classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This code snippet uses the `warnings` module to ignore the specific warning about feature names. Adding the `warnings.filterwarnings` line at the beginning will ensure that you don't see this specific warning.

Run this updated code, and the warning should be suppressed. Let me know if this helps or if you need any further adjustments!
