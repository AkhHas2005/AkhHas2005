# Tips for Engaging YouTube Videos  

## Me
I've recorded an Fc25 (Fifa) Draft video for my YouTube channel, currently I get between 50-250 views on average, however I want this video to be really engaging and I mentioned in teh video that I'll post part 2 if I get 15 likes and 5 subs from part 1 of it. How can I edit the video to potentially achieve this based on the latest trends and YouTube tips?

That's awesome! I'd love to help you make your video more engaging. Here are some tips based on the latest trends and YouTube best practices:

1. **Hook Your Audience Early**: Capture viewers' attention within the first 10-15 seconds.[1] Start with an intriguing question, a surprising fact, or a quick teaser of what's to come.[1]

2. **Use Engaging Visuals**: Incorporate dynamic visuals, animations, and on-screen text to keep viewers interested.[2][3] Make sure your visuals are high-quality and relevant to the content.

3. **Add Music and Sound Effects**: Background music and sound effects can enhance the mood and keep viewers engaged.[2][4] Just make sure the audio doesn't overpower your voice or important sounds.

4. **Include Captions**: Many viewers watch videos without sound, so adding captions can help them follow along and improve accessibility.[5]

5. **Use End Screens and Call-to-Actions**: Guide viewers to other videos, playlists, or your channel subscription page with end screens.[2][6] Encourage them to like and subscribe.[2][7]

6. **Keep It Concise**: Edit out any unnecessary parts to maintain a good pace.[8] Aim for a video length that matches your content and keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.[8]

7. **Engage with Your Audience**: Respond to comments, ask questions, and encourage viewers to interact with your content. This can build a sense of community and keep viewers coming back.

8. **Optimize Your Title and Description**: Use relevant keywords in your title and description to improve searchability.[9] Make sure your title is catchy and accurately represents the content of your video.[9]

9. **Promote Your Video**: Share your video on social media, forums, and other platforms to reach a wider audience. Engage with your followers and ask them to share your video.

10. **Monitor Your Analytics**: Keep an eye on your YouTube analytics to see what's working and what isn't. Adjust your strategy based on viewer behavior and feedback.
