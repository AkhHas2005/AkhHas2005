# Troubleshooting Power Automate Error  

## Me
I'm trying to collect form data from the latest response and put it into a SharePoint List using power Automate, my flow is:   
`Forms: When a new response is submitted -> Forms: Get Response Details -> SharePoint: Create Item`  
However I keep getting teh following error:  
Object must implement IConvertible. clientRequestId: b1144bfd-f3b2-4cc2-a3da-4474bbb4b36d serviceRequestId: 1ce16ba1-d0bd-a000-ad96-ff6f3fae7943

It sounds like you're encountering a common issue in Power Automate. The "Object must implement IConvertible" error usually occurs when there's a mismatch between the data types expected by the SharePoint list and the data being sent from the form.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check Column Types**: Ensure that the columns in your SharePoint list match the data types of the form responses. For example, if your form submits a date, the corresponding SharePoint column should be of type "Date and Time".

2. **Verify Internal Names**: Sometimes, the internal names of the columns in SharePoint might differ from their display names. Make sure the internal names used in your flow match those in the SharePoint list.

3. **Data Mapping**: Double-check the mapping of form fields to SharePoint columns in your flow. Ensure that each form field is correctly mapped to the corresponding SharePoint column.

4. **Test with Sample Data**: Try running the flow with a sample response to see if it works with known data. This can help pinpoint if the issue is with specific data entries.

5. **Review Error Details**: Look at the error details provided in the flow run. They can give you more insight into which field or data type is causing the issue.

Got it, thanks for sharing the details of your `Create Item` connector configuration. From what I see, the setup looks quite comprehensive. Given your error, here are a few additional troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Data Types**:
   - Make sure that the form data matches the data types expected by the SharePoint list fields.
   - For instance, if "Request Date" expects a date, ensure the form field provides a date format.

2. **Check Field Mappings**:
   - Ensure that the form fields are correctly mapped to the corresponding SharePoint columns.
   - For example, the "Title" field might need to be correctly referenced from your form responses.

3. **Simplify and Test**:
   - Try temporarily reducing the fields to just a few essential ones (e.g., `Title` and `Request Date`) and see if the flow works. If it does, add the fields back one by one to identify the problematic field.

4. **Review Special Characters**:
   - Check for any special characters in the form responses that might be causing the issue. Sometimes, certain characters can lead to conversion errors.

5. **Test with Different Data**:
   - Use different sets of sample data to determine if the issue is with specific form submissions.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you might want to provide more detailed error logs or specifics about the data you're trying to capture. I'm here to help you every step of the way!

Thanks for sharing the details. I can see that the error message points to a `400 BadRequest` with a note saying "Object must implement IConvertible." This typically indicates a data type mismatch or an issue with the data being passed to SharePoint.

Here's a more detailed approach to troubleshooting the issue:

1. **Check Date Format**:
   - Ensure that the "Request Date" field is in the correct format expected by SharePoint. SharePoint usually expects dates in the ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Based on your input (`2024-12-03`), this seems correct, but you might want to double-check the field settings in SharePoint.

2. **Verify Field Lengths**:
   - Make sure none of the text fields (e.g., Title, Requestor Name, etc.) exceed the maximum character limits set in SharePoint. For instance, the "Title" field in SharePoint has a default limit of 255 characters.

3. **Review List Columns**:
   - Confirm that all columns in the SharePoint list are configured to accept the data types you are passing. For example, ensure that the "Request Urgency Value" column can accept the string "Not very urgent".

4. **Special Characters**:
   - Check for any special characters or formatting issues in the input data, particularly in the "Basic Request Info" and "Additional Info" fields. Special characters might need to be encoded or handled differently.

5. **JSON Structure**:
   - In the output, review the JSON structure to ensure it matches the expected format. Sometimes minor discrepancies in JSON formatting can cause conversion errors.

6. **Simplify and Isolate**:
   - Temporarily simplify the flow to create an item with only essential fields like `Title` and `Request Date`. This can help isolate which field might be causing the issue.

Let's try these steps and see if any adjustments resolve the error. If you need more detailed guidance on any specific step, feel free to ask!
