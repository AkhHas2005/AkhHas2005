I tried selecting the folder but it only lets me upload files

It sounds like the OneDrive app on your Redmi Note 10 might not support direct folder uploads. However, you can try a workaround:

1. **Compress the Folder**:
   - Use a file manager app to compress the folder into a ZIP file.
   - Most file manager apps have an option to compress or create a ZIP file.

2. **Upload the ZIP File**:
   - Open the OneDrive app.
   - Tap the **"+"** icon and select **"Upload"**.
   - Navigate to the location of the ZIP file and select it to upload.

3. **Extract the Folder on OneDrive**:
   - Once the ZIP file is uploaded, you can use the OneDrive web interface on a computer to extract the contents.

This method allows you to upload the entire folder as a single file. Let me know if this helps or if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
