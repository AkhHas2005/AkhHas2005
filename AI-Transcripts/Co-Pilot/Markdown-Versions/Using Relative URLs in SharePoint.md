Certainly! When working with SharePoint, you can use relative URLs to link between different pages or resources. Here's how you can use relative URLs in your scenario:

1. **Domain-Relative URL**:
   - A domain-relative URL begins with a forward slash (`/`) and specifies a complete path from the top-level website to the file name.
   - For example: `/sites/Web_Site/Lists/List_Title/AllItems.aspx`.

2. **Website-Relative URL**:
   - A website-relative URL is based on the address of a website object (SPWeb). It does not begin with a forward slash.
   - For example: `Lists/List_Title/AllItems.aspx`.

3. **URL Tokens**:
   - SharePoint supports tokens that you can use in URLs for various situations in development.
   - These tokens can be used in custom actions, links on custom pages, and more.
   - Some tokens are usable only in apps, so be aware of context-specific restrictions.
   - For more details, refer to the [URLs and tokens in SharePoint documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/urls-and-tokens-in-sharepoint).

Remember to adjust the URLs based on your specific SharePoint setup. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

## Me
If my page is called EHM-Guides-(AI-Searchable).aspx and is stored in the site Children's System Support and my webpage I want to link is called index.html in the folder AI-Search in Documents, how can I link to it as a awebpage and not as a file?  

## Co-Pilot
To link to the webpage "index.html" stored in the "AI-Search" folder within the "Documents" section of your SharePoint site, you can create a hyperlink using the domain-relative URL. Here's how:

1. First, determine the domain-relative URL for your target page:
   - If your SharePoint site is named "Children's System Support," the domain-relative URL would be: `/sites/ChildrensSystemSupport/Documents/AI-Search/index.html`.

2. Next, create a hyperlink on your "EHM-Guides-(AI-Searchable).aspx" page:
   - Use an anchor tag (`<a>`) with the `href` attribute set to the domain-relative URL.
   - Example: `<a href="/sites/ChildrensSystemSupport/Documents/AI-Search/index.html">Link to AI-Search</a>`

This will create a clickable link to your webpage. Adjust the URL based on your specific SharePoint setup. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
