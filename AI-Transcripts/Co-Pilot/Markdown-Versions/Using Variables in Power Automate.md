Certainly! In Power Automate, you can create and work with variables to store values. Here's how you can assign a variable to store an input from a text box in your app:

1. **Initialize a Variable**:
   - Sign in to Power Automate.
   - Create or open a cloud flow.
   - Add an action where you want to add a variable.
   - Search for "Initialize variable" and select it.
   - Provide the variable name and choose its data type (e.g., string).
   - Set the initial value for the variable[^1^][1].

2. **Get Value from Text Input in Power Apps**:
   - Add a button control to your Power Apps screen.
   - Set the button's `OnSelect` property with the following expression:
     ```
     OnSelect = Patch(ColName, Defaults(ColName), {UserName: UserName_txtInput.Text});
     Reset(UserName_txtInput)
     ```
     Replace `ColName` with your collection name and `UserName_txtInput` with your text input control[^2^][3].

3. **Set a Text Box to a Variable Value**:
   - You can use a variable to control the state of a text box.
   - For example, set the `Reset` property of the text input control to a variable:
     ```
     Set(varReset, true);
     Set(varReset, false);
     ```
     Alternatively, use a button with the `OnSelect` property:
     ```
     UpdateContext({Variable1: true});
     UpdateContext({Variable1: false});
     ```
     Modify the `Reset` property of the text input control to use `Variable1`[^3^][5].

Remember that variables exist globally within the cloud flow and persist across loop iterations. Feel free to adapt these steps to your specific scenario! ðŸ˜Š

How can I create a collection in power apps (August 2024)?

[2]: https://www.spguides.com/powerapps-collection/ ""
[3]: https://www.matthewdevaney.com/powerapps-collections-cookbook/create-a-collection-from-datasource/ ""

Certainly! To create a collection in Power Apps, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Collection**:
   - Open your app in Power Apps.
   - In the left navigation pane, select the App object.
   - Set its `OnStart` property to the following code:
     ```
     OnStart = Collect(MyCollection, { BookName: "The Testaments", Author: "Margaret Atwood" })
     ```
   - Save and publish the app.

2. **Verify the Collection**:
   - Now, the collection named `MyCollection` has been created.
   - You can access it with all the records you added.

Remember to replace the book details in the example with your own data! ðŸ˜Š [^1^][2]

## Me
It won't work, the collection is empty when I use that code  

## Co-Pilot
I apologize for the oversight. Let's troubleshoot this together. Here are some steps to ensure your collection is initialized correctly:

1. **Check Collection Name**:
   - Confirm that the collection name you're using (`MyCollection`) matches the one in your app.
   - Make sure there are no typos or discrepancies.

2. **Verify the `OnStart` Property**:
   - Go to the App object in the left navigation pane.
   - Double-check the `OnStart` property. It should be set to:
     ```
     OnStart = Collect(MyCollection, { BookName: "The Testaments", Author: "Margaret Atwood" })
     ```
   - Save your changes.

3. **Test the Collection**:
   - Run your app (you can preview it in the Power Apps Studio).
   - Check if the collection contains the record with the book details.
   - If not, try creating a new collection with a different name and test again.

Remember to replace the book details in the example with your own data. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance! ðŸ˜Š

How can I concatenate a string with a variable taken from an inputbox in power apps? (Friday, Aug 2 now)

Certainly! In Power Apps, you have a few options for concatenating strings with variables or input values:

1. **Using $-Strings (String Interpolation)**:
   - The new $-String syntax allows you to easily concatenate text strings with expressions (functions, formulas, or variables) inside curly braces.
   - Example:
     ```
     $\"Hello {User().FullName}. The current date is {Today()}.\"
     ```
     This will display a message with the user's name and the current date[^1^][1].

2. **Using the & Operator**:
   - You can join text strings using the & operator.
   - Example:
     ```
     \"Hello my name is\" & User().FullName & \". The current date is\" & Today() & \".\"
     ```
     This approach is more readable during code review but requires extra typing[^1^][1].

3. **Using the Concatenate Function**:
   - If you prefer a function-based approach, use the Concatenate function.
   - Example:
     ```
     Concatenate(\"Hello my name is\", User().FullName, \". The current date is\", Today(), \".\")
     ```
     Each section of text or expression is supplied as a separate argument[^2^][3].

Choose the method that best suits your preference and readability! ðŸ˜Š

How can I concatenate a string ("Your work hours per day are: ") with a variable taken from an inputbox (TextBox2.Value) in power apps?  

## Co-Pilot
Certainly! To concatenate a string with a variable from an input box in Power Apps, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Label or Text Control**:
   - Add a label or text control to your screen where you want to display the concatenated result.

2. **Set the Text Property**:
   - Select the label or text control.
   - In the Properties pane, find the `Text` property.
   - Set the property to the following formula:
     ```
     "Your work hours per day are: " & TextBox2.Text
     ```
     Replace `TextBox2` with the actual name of your input box control.

3. **Test Your App**:
   - Run your app to see the concatenated result in the label or text control.

This will display the combined string with the value from the input box. ðŸ˜Š
