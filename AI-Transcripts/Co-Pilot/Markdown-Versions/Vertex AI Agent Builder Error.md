Certainly! The error message "Playbook 649a2b15-5abf-413d-9a27-8164d8571423 caused loop in playbook routes" indicates that there's an issue with the routing configuration in your Vertex AI Agent Builder application. To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. **Authorized Domains/Subdomains**: Ensure that you've configured the authorized domains/subdomains under the Vertex Agent Builder Application. Specifically, add the `xxxx.xx.r.appspot.com` (and any other domains you're using) to the authorized list[^1^][1].

2. **App Engine Domain**: If you're using the default URL generated by App Engine (e.g., `https://<gcp-project-id>.uc.r.appspot.com`), copy this domain into the allowed domains section in your configuration[^1^][1].

Remember to adjust the settings according to your specific use case. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for additional assistance! ðŸ˜Š

## Me
This is my instructions forn the agent but it doesn't route to the next agent, why could this be? Instructions: 
- Greet the user and ask them about the software application they want to test, this will provide the context
- Then ask the user to enter the specific question they want to test at the moment
- Next, route to ${AGENT:Relevant Document Scanner}. Do not try to help or answer the question yourself.

Thank you for sharing the instructions! It seems that the routing issue lies in the placeholder text `${AGENT:Relevant Document Scanner}`. Let's address this:

1. **Agent Placeholder**: The placeholder `${AGENT:Relevant Document Scanner}` should be replaced with an actual command or link that triggers routing to another agent within your system. Ensure that the correct agent identifier or routing mechanism is used here.

2. **Syntax and Formatting**: Double-check the syntax and formatting of the routing instruction. Make sure there are no typos or missing characters.

3. **Authorized Domains**: Additionally, ensure that your Vertex AI Agent Builder application is configured with authorized domains/subdomains. If you're using the default URL generated by App Engine (e.g., `https://<gcp-project-id>.uc.r.appspot.com`), copy this domain into the allowed domains section in your configuration[^1^][1].

Feel free to make these adjustments, and if you encounter any further issues, don't hesitate to ask for additional assistance! ðŸ˜Š
