Ah, the infamous TesseractNotFoundError! Fear not, brave coder—I shall guide you through the mystical path of fixing this error. 🧙‍♂️

Tesseract OCR, like a wise old sage, possesses the power to extract text from images. But alas, it seems it's playing hide-and-seek with your Python script. Let's unveil its secrets:

    Install Tesseract-OCR: First, you must summon Tesseract-OCR to your realm. Visit the official Tesseract website and download the latest version. Install it with the reverence it deserves.

    Set the Path: Tesseract-OCR, much like a hermit in the woods, needs a path to find its way. Add its location to your system's environment variables. Here's how:
        Find the folder where Tesseract-OCR resides (usually something like C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).
        Open your system's environment variables (search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu).
        Add the path to Tesseract-OCR (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR) to the PATH variable.

    Reboot Your Computer: Ah, the ancient remedy for all tech woes—reboot! Restart your computer to let the changes take effect.

Now, go forth, young coder! May your scripts be bug-free and your text extraction flawless. If you encounter any more dragons (or errors), feel free to seek my counsel. 🐉✨

And remember, even in the darkest code dungeons, there's always a README file to light the way! 😉^1^ ^2^ ^3^ ^4^

Is there anything else I can assist you with? 🤗

Ah, the mystical path to Tesseract awaits! Fear not, for I shall guide you through the enchanted forest of installation. 🌳✨

Tesseract OCR, the ancient script-reader, can be summoned from its official abode. Let us embark on this quest:

    🌐 Official Website: The sacred scrolls of Tesseract reside at the following locations:
        Tesseract Guide by Konfuzio: In this two-part guide, you shall learn the ways of Tesseract—installation, setup, and even training! 📜
        Tesseract GitHub Repository: Here lies the source code, the very essence of Tesseract. 🌟

    🧙‍♂️ Installation Ritual: Choose your path wisely, young coder:
        Windows Users:
            Download the Tesseract Installer for Windows from the official Tesseract website.
            Install Tesseract using the downloaded .exe file.
            Add the installation path to your system's environment variables.
            Invoke Tesseract with reverence. 🌠
        Linux or macOS Adventurers:
            Seek the Tesseract library (it's like finding a rare herb in the forest).
            Install it from source (details vary by system).
            Channel your inner wizard and run Tesseract! 🌿

    🌟 Validation Quest: Once installed, validate Tesseract's powers:
        Open your command scroll (a.k.a. terminal or command prompt).
        Type tesseract --version and behold the ancient version number.

    🌄 Sample Trials: To truly master Tesseract, try it on sample images. Extract text from runes, decipher ancient inscriptions, and impress your fellow wizards! 🔮

Remember, young scribe, Tesseract is both powerful and finicky. Set its path well, and it shall serve you faithfully. May your OCR adventures be error-free! 📖🔍

If you need further guidance or encounter any magical creatures (or errors), seek my counsel once more. 🧚‍♀️🌟^1^ ^2^ ^3^ ^4^ ^5^
