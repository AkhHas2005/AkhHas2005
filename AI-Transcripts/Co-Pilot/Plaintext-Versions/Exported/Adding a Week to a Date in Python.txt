You can achieve this using Python's datetime module. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Import the necessary classes from the datetime module.
2. Parse the date string into a datetime object.
3. Add one week to the date using timedelta.
4. Format the new date back into the desired string format.

Here's a sample code snippet:

python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

 Step 1: Parse the date string into a datetime object
date_str = "27 August 2024"
date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%d %B %Y")

 Step 2: Add one week to the date
new_date_obj = date_obj + timedelta(weeks=1)

 Step 3: Format the new date back into the desired string format
new_date_str = new_date_obj.strftime("%d %B %Y")

print(new_date_str)   Output: 03 September 2024


This code will output 03 September 2024, which is one week after 27 August 2024.

You can calculate someone's age in whole years using Python's datetime module. Here's a simple way to do it:

1. Import the necessary classes from the datetime module.
2. Parse the date of birth into a datetime object.
3. Get the current date.
4. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year and adjusting if the current date is before the birth date in the current year.

Here's a sample code snippet:

python
from datetime import datetime

 Step 1: Parse the date of birth into a datetime object
dob_str = "18 April 2012"
dob = datetime.strptime(dob_str, "%d %B %Y")

 Step 2: Get the current date
current_date = datetime.today()

 Step 3: Calculate the age in whole years
age = current_date.year - dob.year - ((current_date.month, current_date.day) < (dob.month, dob.day))

print(age)   Output: 12 (as of 27 August 2024)


This code will output 12, which is the age of someone born on 18 April 2012 as of 27 August 2024.

To extract data from a Word document organized as a table using Python, you can use the python-docx library. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you extract the table data:

1. Install the python-docx library if you haven't already:
   bash
   pip install python-docx
   

2. Use the following code to extract the table data:

   python
   from docx import Document

    Load the document
   doc = Document("Example filled Breaking Cycles Referral Form.docx")

    Iterate through the tables in the document
   for table in doc.tables:
       for row in table.rows:
           for cell in row.cells:
               print(cell.text)
   

This code will print the text from each cell in the tables of your Word document.

If you find that python-docx isn't handling the tables as you need, you can consider converting the Word document to a PDF and then extracting the table data from the PDF. Here's how you can do that:

1. Convert the Word document to a PDF using the docx2pdf library:
   bash
   pip install docx2pdf
   

2. Use the following code to convert the document:
   python
   from docx2pdf import convert

    Convert the Word document to PDF
   convert("Example filled Breaking Cycles Referral Form.docx")
   

3. Extract the table data from the PDF using a library like pdfplumber:
   bash
   pip install pdfplumber
   

4. Use the following code to extract table data from the PDF:
   python
   import pdfplumber

    Open the PDF file
   with pdfplumber.open("Example filled Breaking Cycles Referral Form.pdf") as pdf:
       for page in pdf.pages:
           tables = page.extract_tables()
           for table in tables:
               for row in table:
                   print(row)
   

This approach should help you extract the table data accurately. Let me know if you need further assistance!
