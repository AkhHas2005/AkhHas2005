## You
I have a calculation to work out my work hours from a line copied from my calendar, however the calculation is giving an incorrect output, this is the input:
Start 08:30, End 16:15, Lunch 13:10-13:45
This is the calculation (in power apps):

Set(Day1_string, Day1_input.Value); 
Set(startTime, Mid(Day1_string, Find("Start", Day1_string) + 6, Find(",", Day1_string) - Find("Start", Day1_string) - 6)); 
Set(endTime, Mid(Day1_string, Find("End", Day1_string) + 4, Find("Lunch", Day1_string) - Find("End", Day1_string) - 4 - 2)); 
Set(lunchStart, Mid(Day1_string, Find("Lunch", Day1_string) + 6, Find("-", Day1_string) - Find("Lunch", Day1_string) - 6)); 
Set(lunchEnd, Mid(Day1_string, Find("-", Day1_string) + 1, Len(Day1_string) - Find("-", Day1_string)));  

// Convert time values to date/time format 
Set(convertedST, TimeValue(startTime)); 
Set(convertedET, TimeValue(endTime)); 
Set(convertedLS, TimeValue(lunchStart)); 
Set(convertedLE, TimeValue(lunchEnd)); 

// Calculate time differences 
Set(mainDiffHours, DateDiff(convertedST, convertedET, TimeUnit.Hours)); 
Set(lunchDiffMinutes, DateDiff(convertedLS, convertedLE, TimeUnit.Minutes));  

Set( 
  adjustedWorkHours, 
  mainDiffHours - (lunchDiffMinutes / 60) 
); 
Set(workHours, Int(adjustedWorkHours)); 
Set(workMinutes, (adjustedWorkHours - workHours) * 60); 
Set(totalHours, totalHours + workHours); 
Set(totalMinutes, totalMinutes + workMinutes);  

This is the outpyt I'm getting:
Your total hours for all 1 days are 7 hours and 25 minutes.
Your average hours per day are: 7 hours

However, I should be getting this output:
Your total hours for all 1 days are 7 hours and 10 minutes.
Your average hours per day are: 7 hours

It looks like there might be a small error in your calculation logic. Let's break it down step by step to identify where the discrepancy might be.

    Extracting Time Values:
        startTime: 08:30
        endTime: 16:15
        lunchStart: 13:10
        lunchEnd: 13:45

    Converting Time Values to Date/Time Format:
        convertedST: 08:30
        convertedET: 16:15
        convertedLS: 13:10
        convertedLE: 13:45

    Calculating Time Differences:
        mainDiffHours: Difference between convertedST and convertedET in hours.
        lunchDiffMinutes: Difference between convertedLS and convertedLE in minutes.

    Adjusting Work Hours:
        adjustedWorkHours: mainDiffHours - (lunchDiffMinutes / 60)

Let's calculate these manually to verify:

    Total Work Time (without lunch):
        From 08:30 to 16:15 is 7 hours and 45 minutes.

    Lunch Break:
        From 13:10 to 13:45 is 35 minutes.

    Adjusted Work Time:
        7 hours and 45 minutes - 35 minutes = 7 hours and 10 minutes.

So, your expected output of 7 hours and 10 minutes is correct. The issue seems to be in the calculation of mainDiffHours and lunchDiffMinutes.
Possible Fix:

Ensure that mainDiffHours and lunchDiffMinutes are calculated correctly in minutes and then converted to hours accurately.

Set(mainDiffMinutes, DateDiff(convertedST, convertedET, TimeUnit.Minutes));
Set(lunchDiffMinutes, DateDiff(convertedLS, convertedLE, TimeUnit.Minutes));

Set(adjustedWorkMinutes, mainDiffMinutes - lunchDiffMinutes);
Set(adjustedWorkHours, adjustedWorkMinutes / 60);
Set(workHours, Int(adjustedWorkHours));
Set(workMinutes, (adjustedWorkHours - workHours) * 60);
Set(totalHours, totalHours + workHours);
Set(totalMinutes, totalMinutes + workMinutes);

This should give you the correct output of 7 hours and 10 minutes. Let me know if this helps or if you need further assistance!
## You
Can you convert this python code to work in power apps:

overtime = True
hours = self.totalHours - (hoursPerDay * self.dayNum)
absoluteHours = abs(hours)
justHours = absoluteHours // 1
justMinutes = round((absoluteHours - justHours) * 60, 0)
if hours < 0:
  overtime = False

How can I create a custom component using the following code withouit leaving power apps:

import { IInputs, IOutputs } from "./generated/ManifestTypes";  

export class FilePicker implements ComponentFramework.StandardControl<IInputs, IOutputs> {  
  private _container: HTMLDivElement; 
  private _notifyOutputChanged: () => void; 
  private _fileContent: string; 

  constructor() {} 

  public init( 
    context: ComponentFramework.Context<IInputs>, 
    notifyOutputChanged: () => void, 
    state: ComponentFramework.Dictionary, 
    container: HTMLDivElement 
  ): void { 
    this._container = container; 
    this._notifyOutputChanged = notifyOutputChanged;  
    
    const button = document.createElement("button"); 
    button.innerText = "Browse File"; 
    button.onclick = this.openFilePicker.bind(this); 
    this._container.appendChild(button); 
  } 
  
  private openFilePicker(): void { 
    const options: ComponentFramework.DeviceApi.PickFileOptions = { 
      accept: ["text/plain"], 
      allowMultipleFiles: false
    };  

    context.device.pickFile(options).then((files) => { 
      if (files && files.length > 0) { 
        const file = files[0]; 
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (e) => { 
          this._fileContent = e.target.result as string; 
          this._notifyOutputChanged(); 
        }; 
        reader.readAsText(file); 
      } 
    });

  public updateView(context: ComponentFramework.Context<IInputs>): void {} 

  public getOutputs(): IOutputs { 
    return {  
      fileContent: this._fileContent 
    };

## You
I don't want to go into node or anything like that, how can I create it in the default power apps interface?
## Copilot
Got it! If you want to create a custom component directly within the Power Apps interface without diving into Node.js or the Power Apps Component Framework (PCF), you can use the built-in features of Power Apps to achieve similar functionality. Here's a simplified approach:
Step-by-Step Guide to Create a File Picker in Power Apps

Open Power Apps Studio:

    Go to Power Apps and open your app or create a new one.

Add a Button for File Upload:

    Insert a button on your canvas and set its text to "Browse File".

Add a Text Input for File Content:

    Insert a text input box where the file content will be displayed.

Add a Label for File Name:

    Insert a label to display the selected file name.

Add a File Upload Control:

    Power Apps doesn't have a direct file upload control, but you can use the Attachment control from a form. Hereâ€™s how:
        Insert a form (e.g., Edit Form).
        Add an attachment field to the form.
        Hide the form but keep the attachment control visible.

Configure the Button to Trigger File Upload:

    Set the OnSelect property of the button to trigger the attachment control:

    AttachmentControlName.AttachFile()

Handle File Selection:

    Use the OnAddFile property of the attachment control to read the file content:

    Set(fileContent, AttachmentControlName.Attachments[1].Value);
    Set(fileName, AttachmentControlName.Attachments[1].Name);

    Display File Content:
        Set the Default property of the text input box to fileContent.
        Set the Text property of the label to fileName.

Example Code Snippets

Button OnSelect:

AttachmentControlName.AttachFile()

Attachment Control OnAddFile:

Set(fileContent, AttachmentControlName.Attachments[1].Value);
Set(fileName, AttachmentControlName.Attachments[1].Name);

Text Input Default:

fileContent

Label Text:

fileName

This approach allows you to create a basic file picker functionality within Power Apps without needing to use external tools or frameworks. Let me know if you need any more details or further assistance!
