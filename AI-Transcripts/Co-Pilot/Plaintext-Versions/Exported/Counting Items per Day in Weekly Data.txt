Let's break this down, Sherlock-style! 🕵️‍♂️ I'll help you count the items for each day of each week from your data. Here’s a Python script to do the trick:

# Sample data
data = """
Week 1 (actual):
    Monday:
    Installed Android Studio, following MSN vid
    Updated Global Tasks lists
    Sabaq + Class
    Anything else not included
    Tuesday:
    Went to uni all day (8.15am-6.45pm)
    Sabaq + Class
    Anything else not included
    ...
"""

# Function to process the text data
def count_items_per_day(text):
    week_day_counts = {}
    current_week = ""
    current_day = ""
    
    for line in text.split("\n"):
        line = line.strip()
        
        # Determine the week
        if line.startswith("Week"):
            current_week = line.split(" ")[1]
        
        # Determine the day
        elif line.endswith(":") and not line.startswith("Week"):
            current_day = line.replace(":", "").strip()
        
        # Count items for the current day
        else:
            if current_week and current_day:
                key = f"Week {current_week} {current_day}"
                if key not in week_day_counts:
                    week_day_counts[key] = 0
                if line:
                    week_day_counts[key] += 1
    
    return week_day_counts

# Call the function and print results
item_counts = count_items_per_day(data)
for day, count in item_counts.items():
    print(f"{day}: {count} items")

Paste this script into your Python environment. You can update the data variable with your full text data. This will give you a count of items for each day, week by week. Have fun with those numbers!
## You
In google sheets, how can I add colour coding to my cells such that for cells C4 till H9, the cell is green if the number above is less than or equal and red otherwise. Also for cells D10 to H10, I want a similar thing but checking the cells on the left
## Copilot
You can achieve this using Google Sheets' Conditional Formatting feature. Here's how to do it:
For cells C4 to H9:

    Select the range C4:H9.
    Go to Format > Conditional formatting.
    In the Conditional format rules sidebar, under Format cells if, choose Custom formula is.
    Enter the formula: =C4<=C3.
    Set the Formatting style to Green.
    Click Done.

For cells D10 to H10:

    Select the range D10:H10.
    Go to Format > Conditional formatting.
    In the Conditional format rules sidebar, under Format cells if, choose Custom formula is.
    Enter the formula: =D10<=D9.
    Set the Formatting style to Green.
    Click Done.

This will color the cells green if the value is less than or equal to the value in the cell above (for C4:H9) or to the left (for D10:H10), and red otherwise.

Does this help with what you were trying to achieve?
