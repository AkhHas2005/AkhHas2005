In excel, how can I create a column (column C, sheet 2) that contains tick boxes and when the box is ticked, it adds a name from a People column (column A, sheet 2) to a pick list on a diffrent sheet (sheet 1)?
## Copilot
Certainly! Let's break this down into steps:
- Insert Checkboxes in Column C (Sheet 2):
    - Select the range in column C where you want the checkboxes.
    - Go to the Insert tab and click on Checkbox in the Form Controls section.
    - You'll see checkboxes appear in the selected cells.
- Link Checkboxes to Names in Column A (Sheet 2):
    - Now, you want the checkboxes to correspond to names in column A.
    - For each checkbox, right-click it and choose Format Control.
    - In the Control tab, specify a Cell link (e.g., a cell in column D) for each checkbox. This cell will show TRUE when the checkbox is checked and FALSE when unchecked.
- Create the Pick List on Sheet 1:
    - On Sheet 1, create a list (e.g., in column E) with the names you want to include in the pick list.
    - Use a formula to filter this list based on the TRUE/FALSE values from the linked cells in column D (Sheet 2). For example:

=IF(Sheet2!D1, Sheet2!A1, "")

This formula checks if the checkbox in D1 is checked (TRUE) and returns the corresponding name from A1.
- Repeat for Other Rows:
    - Copy the formula down for other rows in column E to include all names based on the checkboxes.
Now, when you check a box in column C (Sheet 2), the corresponding name from column A (Sheet 2) will appear in your pick list on Sheet 1. 🎉
Remember to adjust cell references based on your actual sheet names and ranges! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊

Thank you! Can I also add a dropdown list for the pick list?
## Copilot
Certainly! You can create a dropdown list for the pick list on Sheet 1. Here's how:
- Create the Dropdown List:
    - On Sheet 1, choose a cell where you want the dropdown list.
    - Go to the Data tab and click on Data Validation.
    - In the Settings tab:
        - Set Allow to List.
        - In the Source field, enter the range of names from column E (where you filtered the names based on checkboxes).
    - Click OK.
- Link the Dropdown to the Pick List:
    - Now, when you select a name from the dropdown, it will show the corresponding name from your filtered list.

What about when creating the pick list, if I want to concatenate 2 cells e.g. if sheet 2 cell A1 says "Hasan Akhtar" and sheet 2 cell B1 says "AI Research Intern" then I want the output to be "Hasan Akhtar - AI Research Intern". Bear in mind, I still want the condition to be if sheet 2 cell D1 is True then show the name
## Copilot
Certainly! To create the concatenated output based on the conditions you've described, follow these steps:
- Concatenate Names (Sheet 2):
    - In Sheet 2, create a new column (let's say column E) where you want the concatenated names.
    - Use the following formula in cell E1 (assuming A1 contains the name and B1 contains the role):

=IF(Sheet2!D1, Sheet2!A1 & " - " & Sheet2!B1, "")

This formula checks if the checkbox in D1 is checked (TRUE). If it is, it concatenates the name from A1 with the role from B1, separated by " - ". Otherwise, it leaves the cell blank.
- Create the Pick List on Sheet 1:
    - On Sheet 1, create a list (e.g., in column F) with the concatenated names from column E (where the checkboxes are TRUE).
    - Use a formula similar to the previous one to filter this list based on the TRUE/FALSE values from the linked cells in column D (Sheet 2).
Now, when you check a box in column C (Sheet 2), the corresponding concatenated name will appear in your pick list on Sheet 1. 🎉

How do I create a dropdown list based on data already in my spreadsheet?
## Copilot
Certainly! You can create a dropdown list in Excel or Google Sheets based on data already in your spreadsheet. Here's how:

        - Confirm your selection.
        - Click OK.
- Dropdown List Ready:
    - Now, when you click on the cell, a dropdown arrow will appear, showing the available options from your data.
In Google Sheets:- Select the Cell Range:
    - Choose the cell or cells with existing data.
- Data Validation:
    - Right-click and select Dropdown (or Drop-down in some versions).
    - Make sure to check Ignore Blank and In-Cell Dropdown.
- Choose Data Source:
    - Click on the source icon to select the data for your dropdown list.
    - Confirm your selection.
Now you have a dropdown list based on your existing data! Feel free to ask if you need further assistance 😊👍   .

There is no data validation in the data tab, what dfo I do?
## Copilot
I apologize for the inconvenience. If you're unable to find the data validation option in the Data tab, let's troubleshoot this:
- Check for Disabled Data Validation Button:
    - Go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon.
    - Change to All Commands.
    - Look for the Data Validation button and add it to the ribbon.
- Update Office (Excel 365):
    - Check for updates by going to File > Account.
    - Update your Office if any updates are available.
    - If already up-to-date, try using Online Repair to fix the issue.
- Verify Version and Build:
    - Share a screenshot of the product information from File > Account (including Version and Build number).
    - Also, provide a screenshot of the Data tab ribbon.
Let's troubleshoot step by step, and we'll get this sorted out! 😊👍
