## You
In power apps, how can I create a component when a button is pressed, is there any way to do this or do I have
to create all teh components first and then I can unhide them when the button is clicked?

Certainly! In Power Apps, you can create a component that responds to a button press. Here are a few approaches:

1. Button Control with OnSelect Property:
   - Add a button control to your app.
   - Set its OnSelect property to execute the desired action when the button is pressed[^1^][5].
   - For example, you can use the following formula in the OnSelect property:
     
     Set(varShowMenu, false);
     
   - Click on the button to trigger the action.

2. Custom Component with Behavioral Properties:
   - Create a custom component (canvas component) that encapsulates your desired behavior.
   - Add properties to the component (e.g., onCancel, onSubmit).
   - Set the OnSelect property of buttons within the component to the corresponding property value.
   - Use the component in your main screen and update the property values to control visibility or behavior[^2^][3].

3. Split Button Component:
   - Build a split button component (e.g., cmp_SplitButton).
   - Add a main button (btn_main) with an OnSelect property that calls cmp_SplitButton.OnSelect().
   - This approach allows you to determine if the button was selected in your app[^3^][6].

Remember to adapt these approaches based on your specific requirements. Feel free to explore other options as well! ðŸ˜Š
