That sounds like a lot of fun! Here are some cool and interesting ideas for your map:

    Mystery Adventure: Create a map filled with puzzles, hidden treasures, and secret passages. Players can work together to solve riddles and uncover the map's mysteries.
    Survival Challenge: Design a map where players must survive in a harsh environment, gathering resources, building shelters, and defending against waves of enemies.
    Prop Hunt: Hide various props around the map, and players must find and collect them within a time limit. You can add twists like decoy props and special power-ups.
    Build Wars: Set up a map where players compete in building challenges, such as creating the tallest structure or the most elaborate fortification within a time limit.
    Zombie Escape: Create a map where players must escape from a horde of zombies, using their building skills to create barriers and traps to slow down the zombies.
    Theme Park: Build a fun and interactive theme park with various rides, games, and attractions. Players can explore the park, complete challenges, and collect rewards.
    Time Travel Adventure: Design a map that takes players through different historical eras, with each area featuring unique challenges and enemies from that time period.
    Underwater World: Create an underwater map with hidden treasures, underwater creatures, and challenges that require players to use their building skills to navigate the depths.
    Sky City: Build a floating city in the sky, with platforms, bridges, and obstacles that players must traverse to reach the top.
    Fortnite x Minecraft: Combine elements from both games to create a unique crossover map, featuring Minecraft-style blocks and structures in the Fortnite world.

These ideas should keep your viewers entertained and engaged during your livestream. Which one do you think you'll try first?
