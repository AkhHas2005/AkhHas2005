## You
I want to design a web application that meets the following requirements:

    Can connect to a web database
    Has a webpage front end
    Can be deployed on devices of companies with non-technical employees and they can access/use it easily
    Only needs to be setup once and then will work every time someone logs on
    Users can upload documents to the web page front end
    Users can download pdf reports from the web page front end
    The front end can be hosted on my GitHub pages website through my GitHub repository

Designing a web application that meets all these requirements is a great project! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis

    Understand the Project Goals: Clearly define what your web application aims to achieve.
    Identify Target Audience: Ensure the application is user-friendly for non-technical employees.

2. Planning

    Project Plan: Outline the scope, timeline, budget, resources, and milestones^1^.

3. Design

    User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Design a simple and intuitive interface using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
    Responsive Design: Ensure the application works well on various devices and screen sizes.

4. Front-End Development

    Technologies: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like React or Vue.js can help create a dynamic and responsive front end^1^.
    File Upload and Download: Implement features for users to upload documents and download PDF reports.

5. Back-End Development

    Server-Side Logic: Use languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP to handle server-side operations.
    Database Connection: Connect to a web database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB^1^.

6. Database Development

    Schema Design: Design the database schema to store user data and uploaded documents.
    Data Security: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data.

7. Integration

    APIs: Use APIs to connect the front end with the back end and the database.

8. Testing

    Unit Testing: Test individual components.
    Integration Testing: Ensure all parts work together seamlessly.
    User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Get feedback from non-technical users to ensure usability^1^.

9. Deployment

    GitHub Pages: Host the front end on GitHub Pages. Ensure your repository is public and the site is correctly configured.
    Server Deployment: Deploy the back end and database on a cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Heroku^1^.

10. Maintenance

    Regular Updates: Keep the application updated with the latest security patches and features.
    User Support: Provide support for users to address any issues they encounter.
