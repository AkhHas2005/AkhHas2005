No, gorillas are not monkeys. Gorillas belong to a different group of primates known as apes. This group also includes humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gibbons^1^^2^.

Here are some key differences:

    Classification: Gorillas are classified as apes in the family Hominidae, while monkeys belong to various other families within the primate order^2^.
    Physical Traits: Gorillas are generally larger and heavier than monkeys. They also lack tails, which most monkeys have^3^.
    Behavior: Gorillas are predominantly ground-dwelling, whereas many monkeys are more arboreal (tree-dwelling)^4^.
