what emoji would describe the meme sound: "Mission failed, we'll get him next time"?
## Copilot
Ah, the classic "Mission failed, we'll get him next time" meme! 🙌 It's like the virtual equivalent of a friendly pat on the back after a minor setback. You know, that moment when you're playing a game, and things don't quite go as planned, but you're still optimistic about future attempts? Yep, that's the one!

Now, as for an emoji to capture that spirit... 🤔 I'd say the "Face with Slightly Smiling Eyes" emoji (😊) fits the bill. It's like saying, "Hey, it didn't work out this time, but no worries—we've got this!" 😄

Got any other memes or fun phrases you'd like to emoji-fy? I'm all ears—or rather, all text! 😉
