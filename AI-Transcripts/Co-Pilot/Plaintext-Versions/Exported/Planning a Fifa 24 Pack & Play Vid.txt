## You
I'm planning a pack and play vid with my cousin where one of us shares screen and records it and opens the packs, we get to choose players from the packs and upgrade whoever we want and can afford then play the game with our stacked teams, which packs can I open in fc24? There are 10 85x10s, unlimited 84x10s and other packs available. How can I plan for this video?

That sounds like a fun video idea! Here are some tips to help you plan your pack and play video for FC24:

 Choosing Packs to Open
1. 85x10 Packs: These packs are great for getting high-rated players. Since you have 10 of these, you can expect to get some top-tier players to build a strong team.
2. 84x10 Packs: With unlimited access to these packs, you can keep opening them until you get the players you want. This will help you fill any gaps in your squad with quality players.
3. Other Packs: Consider opening packs like the 83+ x25 Players Pack or the 81+ Rare Players 25 Pack for a mix of high-rated players and potential hidden gems[^1^][2].

 Planning the Video
1. Introduction: Start with a brief introduction explaining the rules of your pack and play challenge. Mention the types of packs you'll be opening and the goal of building the best team possible.
2. Pack Opening: Record the screen as you open the packs. Make sure to capture your reactions to big pulls and discuss potential upgrades for your team.
3. Team Building: After opening the packs, show the process of building your team. Discuss your choices and strategies for upgrading players.
4. Gameplay: Play a match with your newly built teams. Record the gameplay and provide commentary on how the new players are performing.
5. Conclusion: Wrap up the video with a summary of the match and your thoughts on the pack and play challenge. You can also discuss any future plans for similar videos.

 Additional Tips
- Engage with Your Audience: Ask viewers to comment on their favorite pulls or suggest future challenges.
- Editing: Keep the video engaging by editing out any long pauses or uninteresting parts. Add some background music and on-screen graphics to highlight key moments.
- Thumbnail and Title: Create an eye-catching thumbnail and a compelling title to attract viewers.

Good luck with your video! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
