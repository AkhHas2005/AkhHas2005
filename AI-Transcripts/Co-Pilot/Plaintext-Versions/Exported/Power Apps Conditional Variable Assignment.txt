how can I write an if statement for a formula in power apps: I want the formula to set a variable called hours to Textbox2.value if the selected item in ComboBox1 is per day and if it's per week divide this value by 5?

Certainly! In Power Apps, you can use the If function to create conditional statements. Let's break down your requirement:
- If the selected item in ComboBox1 is "per day," set the hours variable to Textbox2.Value.
- If the selected item in ComboBox1 is "per week," divide Textbox2.Value by 5.
Here's how you can write this in Power Apps:

Set(hours,
    If(ComboBox1.Selected.Value = "per day",
        Textbox2.Value,
        Textbox2.Value / 5
    )
)

Explanation:
- The If function checks the condition (whether the selected item is "per day").
- If true, it assigns Textbox2.Value to the hours variable.
- If false (i.e., "per week"), it divides Textbox2.Value by 5.
Feel free to adjust the field names and values according to your specific app setup! ðŸ˜Š

How can I declare/assign a new variable called hours?
## Copilot
Certainly! To declare and assign a new variable called hours in Power Apps, you can use the Set function. Here's how you can do it:

Set(hours, 0)  // Initialize the variable with a default value (e.g., 0)

Replace 0 with the appropriate initial value if needed. Now you can use the hours variable in your app! ðŸ˜Š
