Yes, you can start making voluntary repayments on your student loan while you're still studying. Here are a few ways to do this:

Online Account: You can make extra repayments through your online account with the Student Loans Company (SLC). This can be done via card, bank transfer, or cheque^1^.
Direct Debit: Setting up a direct debit is another option. This allows you to make regular payments directly from your bank account^2^.
Keep in mind that while making extra repayments can reduce the overall interest you'll pay, it's important to ensure you have enough funds for your living expenses and other needs during your studies.
