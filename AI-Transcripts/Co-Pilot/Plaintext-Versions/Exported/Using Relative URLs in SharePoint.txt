How I can I use the relative url of a webpage stored in the team documents section of sharepoint in a page stored in the pages section of sharepoint?
## Copilot
Certainly! When working with SharePoint, you can use relative URLs to link between different pages or resources. Here's how you can use relative URLs in your scenario:
- Domain-Relative URL:
    - A domain-relative URL begins with a forward slash (/) and specifies a complete path from the top-level website to the file name.
    - For example: /sites/Web_Site/Lists/List_Title/AllItems.aspx.
- Website-Relative URL:
    - A website-relative URL is based on the address of a website object (SPWeb). It does not begin with a forward slash.
    - For example: Lists/List_Title/AllItems.aspx.
- URL Tokens:
    - SharePoint supports tokens that you can use in URLs for various situations in development.
    - These tokens can be used in custom actions, links on custom pages, and more.
    - Some tokens are usable only in apps, so be aware of context-specific restrictions.
    - For more details, refer to the URLs and tokens in SharePoint documentation.
Remember to adjust the URLs based on your specific SharePoint setup. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

If my page is called EHM-Guides-(AI-Searchable).aspx and is stored in the site Children's System Support and my webpage I want to link is called index.html in the folder AI-Search in Documents, how can I link to it as a awebpage and not as a file?
## Copilot
To link to the webpage "index.html" stored in the "AI-Search" folder within the "Documents" section of your SharePoint site, you can create a hyperlink using the domain-relative URL. Here's how:
- First, determine the domain-relative URL for your target page:
    - If your SharePoint site is named "Children's System Support," the domain-relative URL would be: /sites/ChildrensSystemSupport/Documents/AI-Search/index.html.
- Next, create a hyperlink on your "EHM-Guides-(AI-Searchable).aspx" page:
    - Use an anchor tag (<a>) with the href attribute set to the domain-relative URL.
    - Example: <a href="/sites/ChildrensSystemSupport/Documents/AI-Search/index.html">Link to AI-Search</a>
This will create a clickable link to your webpage. Adjust the URL based on your specific SharePoint setup. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
