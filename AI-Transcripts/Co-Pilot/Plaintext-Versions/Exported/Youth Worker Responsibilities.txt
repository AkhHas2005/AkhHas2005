## Copilot
Youth workers play a crucial role in supporting young people by engaging in one-to-one interactions to understand their needs and challenges. They meticulously document these interactions by writing detailed case notes from each visit, ensuring that all relevant information is recorded for future reference. Additionally, youth workers attend professional meetings to collaborate with other professionals, share insights, and develop comprehensive support plans. An essential part of their responsibilities includes conducting missing return home interviews, where they gather information from young people who have returned after being reported missing, using structured word forms to ensure consistency and thoroughness in their reports. This multifaceted approach helps youth workers provide tailored support and interventions to help young people thrive.
