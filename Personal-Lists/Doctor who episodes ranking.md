## Top 20 Worst Doctor Who episodes <br> (https://youtu.be/IQROvNvBwIc?si=5-Tr66-1bhlrlmGT)

### My ratings for these episodes 

#### Note - order is how they appeared in video (from 20 - 1 as 1 - 20)

1. Empire of Death: 7.6/10, didn't dislike it that much, thought it was good
2. The wedding of River Song: 8.2/10, thought it was really good, liked the mashing of past, present and future and subplot
3. Planet of the Dead: 3.4/10, honestly didn't like this episode at all, apart from chracter of Prof Malcolm, really boring
4. The Long Game: 5.4/10, haven't rewatched in long time so don't really remember much, mid rating therefore
5. Space Babies: 6.1/10, quite bopring and childish episode, definitely not fit for season opener
6. The Caretaker: 7.5/10, actually thought this episode was decent, liked the doctor undercover as a caretaker for second time, subplot decent
7. New Earth: 6.9/10, enjoyed the story apart from Cassandra parts, decent opener and continuation from series 1
8. The Rings of Akhaten: 8.1/10, excellent speech by Doctor towards end of story, other than that was ok
9. The Woman who lived: 6.7/10, decent continuation of story ark but kinda lackluster subplot
10. The Tsuranga conundrum: 2.6/10, definitely an episode to forget, when watched it originally skipped through, not watched it since
11. Closing Time: 8.5/10, liked continuation of story with Craig, cyberman element was quite good as well imo
12. Lie of the Land: 7.1/10, liked some aspects of it, especially the fake regeneration, but climax kinda bad
13. Journey to the Centre of the Tardis: 8.7/10, really liked this one with the Tardis interior shown and some good scenes and concepts
14. Orphan 55: 4.2/10, really didn't like the atmosphere of this episode and how it doesn't line up with existing lore
15. The curse of the black spot: 6.5/10, kinda mid episode but decent scenes and concept, misunderstood monster theme did well here
16. In the Forest of the night: 4.9/10, worse than mid, story plot was kinda weak and no real conviction
17. The battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos: 7.8/10, contrary to popular opinion, actually liked this story with the returning villain and high-stakes scenes
18. Nightmare in Silver: 8.1/10, liked the cyberman ascension and upgrade lore, also liked cyber controller fighting with 11th Doctor and interesting resolution, to top it off reveal of that short guy as king is fascinating imo
19. Legend of the sea devils: 3.7/10, confusing choppy mess of an episode, only slightly helped by Dan being in it
20. Fear her: 6.3/10, decent episode, liked the idea of drawings coming to life, but characters and background subplot didn't really work that well tbf
