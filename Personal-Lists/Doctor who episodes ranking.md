## Top 20 Worst Doctor Who episodes (https://youtu.be/IQROvNvBwIc?si=5-Tr66-1bhlrlmGT)

### My ratings for these episodes

20. Empire of Death: 7.6/10, didn't dislike it that much, thought it was good
19. The wedding of River Song: 8.2/10, thought it was really good, liked the mashing of past, present and future and subplot
18. Planet of the Dead: 3.4/10, honestly didn't like this episode at all, apart from chracter of Prof Malcolm, really boring
17. The Long Game: 5.4/10, haven't rewatched in long time so don't really remember much, mid rating therefore
16. Space Babies: 6.1/10, quite bopring and childish episode, definitely not fit for season opener
15. The Caretaker: 7.5/10, actually thought this episode was decent, liked the doctor undercover as a caretaker for second time, subplot decent
14. New Earth: 6.9/10, enjoyed the story apart from Cassandra parts, decent opener and continuation from series 1
13. The Rings of Akhaten: 8.1/10, excellent speech by Doctor towards end of story, other than that was ok
12. The Woman who lived: 6.7/10, decent continuation of story ark but kinda lackluster subplot
11. The Tsuranga conundrum: 2.6/10, definitely an episode to forget, when watched it originally skipped through, not watched it since
10. Closing Time: 8.5/10, liked continuation of story with Craig, cyberman element was quite good as well imo
