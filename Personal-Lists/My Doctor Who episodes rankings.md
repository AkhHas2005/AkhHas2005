## Top 10 Worst Doctor Who episodes (imo)

### My ratings for these episodes (1-10 being least bad at 1 to worst at 10)

1. Kill the Moon: 6.1/10, climax of this one was kinda bad
2. It Takes you Away: 5.7/10, concept of this story was definitely lacking, most scenes not good
3. Demons of the Punjab: 5.5/10, didn't really like this one...
4. Space Babies: 5.1/10, a bit childish, agree with official rating
5. In the Forest of the night: 4.9/10, worse than mid, story plot was kinda weak and no real conviction
6. Orphan 55: 4.2/10, really didn't like the atmosphere of this episode and how it doesn't line up with existing lore
7. Legend of the sea devils: 3.7/10, confusing choppy mess of an episode, only slightly helped by Dan being in it
8. Planet of the Dead: 3.4/10, honestly didn't like this episode at all, apart from chracter of Prof Malcolm, really boring
9. The Tsuranga conundrum: 2.6/10, definitely an episode to forget, when watched it originally skipped through, not watched it since
10. Dot and Bubble: 1.5/10, my least favourite episode, safe to say won't be watching this again for time

## Top 10 Best Doctor Who episodes (imo)

### My ratings for these episodes (1-10 being least good at 1 to best at 10)

1. Spyfall - part 2: 7.2/10, reveal of master was insane ngl and also liked how Doctor went back and time and saved companions from plane
2. Dinosaurs on a Spaceship: 7.4/10, actually enjoyed this episode, great mix of past and future
3. Return of Doctor Mysterio: 7.5/10, great storyline and Doctor action, however let down a bit by lack of resolution
4. Unquiet Dead: 7.7/10, liked inclusion of Charles Dickens and was quite good episode overall
5. Journey to Centre of Tardis: 7.9/10, inclusion of some extra lore which was erased afterwards was handy, meant that stuff happened that didn't have to impact future story
6. Time of the Doctor: 8.2, went well as last story for 11th Doctor
7. Army of Ghosts/Doomsday: 8.4/10, was great season finale for Rose's departure and other events were great
8. Twice upon a Time: 8.9/10, one of my favourite episodes, includes Murray Gold's best bangers as well as inclusion of 1st Doctor top tier
9. Hell Bent/Heaven Sent: 9.5/10, Heaven sent widely reagrded as one of best episodes, however also really like Hell Bent and Doctor's return to Gallifrey "*the long way round*"
10. Day of the Doctor: 9.9/10, One of teh Best 50th Anniversary episodes there could've every been
