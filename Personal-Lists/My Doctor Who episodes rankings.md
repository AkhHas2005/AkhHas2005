# My worst and best doctor who episodes ranked
Note: this ranking is as of August 2024, still in progress atm  

## Top 10 Worst Doctor Who episodes (imo)

### My ratings for these episodes (1-10 being least bad at 1 to worst at 10)

1. In the Forest of the night: 4.9/10, worse than mid, story plot was kinda weak and no real conviction
2. Orphan 55: 4.2/10, really didn't like the atmosphere of this episode and how it doesn't line up with existing lore
3. Legend of the sea devils: 3.7/10, confusing choppy mess of an episode, only slightly helped by Dan being in it
4. Planet of the Dead: 3.4/10, honestly didn't like this episode at all, apart from chracter of Prof Malcolm, really boring
5. The Tsuranga conundrum: 2.6/10, definitely an episode to forget, when watched it originally skipped through, not watched it since
